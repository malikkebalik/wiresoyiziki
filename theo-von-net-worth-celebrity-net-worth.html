That year Von was cast in the <a href=# title="Chris Pratt Net Worth">Chris Pratt</a> science-fiction film "The Tomorrow War," but he later dropped out because of the time commitment.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-317525 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/theo.jpg alt width=571 height=432 sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-317525 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Theo Von was once romantically linked to reality star <a href=# title="Brandi Glanville Net Worth">Brandi Glanville</a> but has since kept his personal life private.</p><p>Theo has said that he decided to get sober when he showed up to a radio interview after a night of using cocaine and "couldn't even talk." He said of that day, "The main gift that God had given me was my voice. And I couldn't even use it because I've been up all night just using drugs to feel good somehow, or using drugs to feel anything."</p><p>Former MLB player&nbsp;<a href=#>Darryl Strawberry</a> was a fellow guest on the show and was 13 years sober at the time. Von realized that something needed to change in his life and began going to AA meetings. He stated:</p><p>"<strong>I sat down and listened to people tell stories – which were my favorite thing to hear. My whole life I've been loving stories, man. I love your story. You know, whatever your story is I love it man because all my life when I was young I just wanted a different story.</strong>"</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In March 2021, Von paid $1.645 million for a 4,918 square foot home in Nashville, Tennessee. He purchased the home from former Vanderbilt head coach Derek Mason, who paid $1.095 million for it in 2014.
