When Sorrentino was called to be on&nbsp;Jersey Shore, the couple took a break for “however long&nbsp;Jersey Shore&nbsp;was,” Pesce recalled to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Us Weekly</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_27>From 2009 to 2012, Sorrentino and Pesce were not a couple. She said they rekindled their love for one another the spring after&nbsp;Jersey Shore&nbsp;ended its original run.&nbsp;</p><h2>‘The Situation’ settled down after ‘Jersey Shore’&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-6_57>Pesce explained how, even though Sorrentino was filming in New Jersey and still lived there, she never ran into him during their time apart. “I had friends and family and people that would always run into him,” she told Us Weekly. “In, like, five or six years, however long that break was, I never ran into him.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_13>She said their running into one another again “was kind of like fate.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_21>When&nbsp;Jersey Shore&nbsp;ended in December 2012, Sorrentino was a single man. Then, in the spring of 2013, Sorrentino’s life changed forever.</p><p id=par-9_41>“I was at a kickboxing gym,” Pesce explained. “He knew I was going there because I kept seeing his family there. He knew what class I took every night and then he showed up. We connected and that was just it.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-10_37>Regardless of how long they had been apart, Sorrentino and Pesce’s relationship evolved quickly. “Even though we were on such a long break — like, years — once we reconnected, it was full steam ahead,” Pesce added.&nbsp;</p><h2>Sorrentino remembered his college days with Pesce on Instagram</h2><p id=par-11_24>Sorrentino has been happily married to his college sweetheart since November 2018. The couple tied the knot before he began his eight-month prison sentence.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_24>Sorrentino, who is extremely active on social media, shared a sweet throwback photo from when he and Pesce were together in college, before&nbsp;Jersey Shore.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-13_28>“Beside every strong Man is an even Stronger Woman,” he captioned the photo. “This was a 2004 Christmas/New Years trip with my family,” Pesce added in the comments.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_26>Many fans were super supportive of the couple, writing: “I’m so inspired by you and Laurens, please write a book one day about your love story.”</p><p id=par-15_10>Other fans had questions about Sorrentino and Pesce’s dating timeline.</p><p id=par-16_22>“Let me ask you a question,” one fan commented. “When you did the show&nbsp;Jersey Shore, Mike — were you still dating Laurens?”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-17_18>Sorrentino replied: “No, we were broken up when the first&nbsp;Jersey Shore&nbsp;started and eventually reconnected after the first&nbsp;Jersey Shore&nbsp;ended.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-18_23>Still, fans questioned Sorrentino’s commitment to Pesce. When one fan implied Sorrentino cheated on her, he had no choice but to clap back.&nbsp;</p><h2>Mike called someone an ‘idiot’ for thinking he cheated on Lauren</h2><p id=par-19_19>Another fan replied on Sorrentino’s Instagram post, writing: “And you continued to cheat on her those subsequent seasons? Boo!”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-20_44>Sorrentino replied directly to this person. “[You’re] an idiot!” he wrote, adding: “If you read the above caption, it says we broke up season 1 of&nbsp;Jersey Shore&nbsp;and reconnected [when] it ended after season 6. So when&nbsp;Jersey Shore: Family Vacation&nbsp;started, we were back together. SMFH.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-21_31>As Pesce explained to Us Weekly, the two were on a break when he was filming the show. Therefore, there was no harm in Sorrentino dating or hooking up on&nbsp;Jersey Shore.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-22_36>While many fans seem to think Sorrentino was cheating on Pesce during the early seasons of the MTV show, in reality, he wasn’t. Today, the couple is happily married, serving as an inspiration to many fans.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxqrCMpqCknV2ptaZ50qKrrpmknryvedKoqaudnqm2r7uMnq2eql2Ytaat02amp2WYnsBuw8ifnGakkaq%2FprqMqZysm5VjtbW5y2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-mike-the-situation-sorrentino-ever-cheat-on-his-wife-lauren-pesce.html&text=Did%20Mike%20The%20Situation%20Sorrentino%20Ever%20Cheat%20on%20His%20Wife%2c%20Lauren%20Pesce%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-mike-the-situation-sorrentino-ever-cheat-on-his-wife-lauren-pesce.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-mike-the-situation-sorrentino-ever-cheat-on-his-wife-lauren-pesce.html&title=Did%20Mike%20The%20Situation%20Sorrentino%20Ever%20Cheat%20on%20His%20Wife%2c%20Lauren%20Pesce%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-mike-the-situation-sorrentino-ever-cheat-on-his-wife-lauren-pesce.html&title=Did%20Mike%20The%20Situation%20Sorrentino%20Ever%20Cheat%20on%20His%20Wife%2c%20Lauren%20Pesce%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-mike-the-situation-sorrentino-ever-cheat-on-his-wife-lauren-pesce.html&title=Did%20Mike%20The%20Situation%20Sorrentino%20Ever%20Cheat%20on%20His%20Wife%2c%20Lauren%20Pesce%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-mike-the-situation-sorrentino-ever-cheat-on-his-wife-lauren-pesce.html&description=Did%20Mike%20The%20Situation%20Sorrentino%20Ever%20Cheat%20on%20His%20Wife%2c%20Lauren%20Pesce%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-do-you-convert-fischer-projection-to-haworth-projection.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How do you convert Fischer projection to Haworth projection?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dewey-bunnell-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dewey Bunnell Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
