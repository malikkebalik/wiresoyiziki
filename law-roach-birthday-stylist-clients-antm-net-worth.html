Let’s dive deep into the life of Law Roach, and he keeps up with the celebrity clients swarming his way. All right now.</p><h2>Law Roach: Quick Facts</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Full Name:</th><td>Law Roach</td></tr><tr><th>Age:</th><td>43 years</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Date:</th><td>July 20, 1978</td></tr><tr><th>Horoscope:</th><td>Cancer</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Place:</th><td>Chicago, Illinois, The United States of America</td></tr><tr><th>Education:</th><td>Harlan Community Academy</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality:</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th>Eye color:</th><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><th>Hair color:</th><td>Black</td></tr><tr><th>Marital Status:</th><td>Single</td></tr><tr><th>Profession:</th><td>Celebrity Stylist</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth:</th><td>$1-$5 million</td></tr><tr><th>Social Media:</th><td><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Law Roach: The Hottest Stylist Who Transformed Celine Dion and Zendaya</h2><p>From an early age, Law Roach has been into fashion, especially women’s clothing. Ever since his single mother introduced him to the films of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Diana Ross</a>: Lady Sings the Blues, The Wiz, and mainly Mahogany, Roach has been obsessed with the iconography of women.</p><p>Because of his love for fashion and owning something no one had, Law fell in love with the art of thrifting, which he thinks is an art form. Likewise, he also fell in love with women’s pieces, such as handbags, shoes, dresses, and everything.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/law-001.jpg><p>After countless thrifting with his grandmother, Roach began selling his vintage collections while working as a bartender. Then in 2009, together with his close friend, <strong>Siobhan Strong</strong>, Roach opened Deliciously Vintage, a storefront at Halsted and 18th in Pilsen.</p><p>During their times, the shop was known for collecting classic vintage clothing from designer pieces to illest secondhand find whatever caught their eyes. The shop was building quite a reputation when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Kanye West</a> dropped unannounced in the spring of 2009, and their fame skyrocketed.</p><h3>Law Roach Identifies Himself as Image Architect</h3><p>Since the event in 2009, Law Roach has significantly made a name for himself thanks to his A-list clients like Zendaya, Celine Dion,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> K.

As per his approach, styling goes beyond putting fantastic outfits on his clients.</p><p>Law then explained,</p><h3>“I’m very cerebral about my craft. So, I actually create a blueprint for the girls that I’m working with. It’s what architects do, and instead of building houses, I’m building images.”</h3><p>Apart from styling the divas of Hollywood, Law also served as creative director for the latest Tommy x Zendaya collection. Moreover, he also served as a judge on America’s Next Top Model, a fashion-forward mentor.</p><h2>Age and Height: How Old Is Law Roach?</h2><p>It is no secret that Law Roach has helped many powerful women in the entertainment industry become a fashion icon. Just look at Zendaya and Celine Dion, for example. His dedication and work sum up with their head-turning assemble and attire.</p><p>However, much to our liking, not much has been shared about himself. Born on July 20, 1978, the celebrity stylist is 43 years as of now. Not to mention, Roach was born under the sun sign of Cancer, and people of this sign are known to be emotional, sensitive, and hard-working individuals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/law-002.jpg><p>Aside from the fact that his creativity in styling women has no limit, there is a limit to what we know about him. As of now, no details are there on Law’s height, weight, and other measurements.</p><p>However, we can see that the black-haired gentleman is relatively tall and has an attractive pair of dark brown eyes. Also, you will never see him slagging off with some pajamas or loose pants, no, no! Just like his clients, Law is styled to perfection.</p><h2>Early Life and Education: Where Is Law Roach From?</h2><p>Despite many claims and disbelief, Law Roach is, in fact, is his real name. Law was born to his parents in Chicago, Illinois, the United States of America. The oldest of five siblings, Roach, was practically raised by his single mother, where his father was absent the whole time.</p><p>Without a doubt, the family of six had a hard life growing up in the states. But the situation never hindered him from getting the education Law needed.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miguel Herran Rio, Age, Height, Career, Girlfriend, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>Moreover, the Chicago native attended Harlan Community Academy on the Far South Side and then studied psychology at Chicago State University. But it was adamant that Law had a passion for fashion from an early age.</p><h2>Net Worth and Income</h2><p>Law Roach is not a new name when it comes to the fashion scene in Hollywood. In fact, he has a long list of clients who wants him to style him most of the time. From Zendaya, his most extended client to Celine Dion and even Arian Grande, most of them are the top in their respective fields.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/law-003.jpg><p>With such an impressive roster of names, it is evident that Law’s income comes close to six-figure earnings, if not more. As of now, it is stated that Law Roach makes around <strong>$1 million to $5 million</strong>.</p><p>However, the exact income and earnings have not been revealed in public. So, we can bet that the celebrity stylist earns definitely more than we have heard.</p><h2>Personal Life: Is Law Roach Married? Is He Gay?</h2><p>Talking about his own life, Law Roach is single as of now. It seems the celebrity stylist has not found special someone, ‘him’ to be precise, to share his life with. Yes, if you guessed Law to be gay, then you are correct.</p><p>Surprisingly, Law never had to come out as gay to his high school peers and friends. Law stated that it was just natural with him, from his feminine mannerisms to his soft voice, it was apparent.</p><p>Furthermore, it was also the support of his friends that helped him get comfortable with his sexuality. He explained how he was bullied and termed ‘faggot’ once every while, but Law’s friends will step up and protect him.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Money Heist Professor Alvaro Morte Age, Career, Wife, Net Worth, >></a></h4><p>Now coming to the present state, Law is not a bit worried about the lack of action in his love life in any way. In fact, with the absence of someone to cuddle and spent his time with, Roach uses all of his energy, focusing on his clients and so on.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Instagram</a>–&nbsp; 527k Followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Twitter</a>–&nbsp; 13.4k Followers</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57y5quZqqflrCpew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flaw-roach-birthday-stylist-clients-antm-net-worth.html&text=Law%20Roach%3a%20Birthday%2c%20Stylist%2c%20Clients%2c%20ANTM%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flaw-roach-birthday-stylist-clients-antm-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flaw-roach-birthday-stylist-clients-antm-net-worth.html&title=Law%20Roach%3a%20Birthday%2c%20Stylist%2c%20Clients%2c%20ANTM%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flaw-roach-birthday-stylist-clients-antm-net-worth.html&title=Law%20Roach%3a%20Birthday%2c%20Stylist%2c%20Clients%2c%20ANTM%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flaw-roach-birthday-stylist-clients-antm-net-worth.html&title=Law%20Roach%3a%20Birthday%2c%20Stylist%2c%20Clients%2c%20ANTM%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flaw-roach-birthday-stylist-clients-antm-net-worth.html&description=Law%20Roach%3a%20Birthday%2c%20Stylist%2c%20Clients%2c%20ANTM%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./matpat-from-game-theory-announces-big-changes-to-the-theorist-youtube-channels.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="MatPat from Game Theory announces big changes to the Theorist YouTube channels">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./betty-white-s-longtime-carmel-home-pops-up-for-8-million.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Betty White's Longtime Carmel Home Pops Up For $8 Million">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
