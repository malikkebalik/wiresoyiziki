At this point, it probably goes without saying that Jennifer Aniston is one of the most famous and highly sought after comedic actresses in Hollywood. She consistently earns $20+ million per year from acting and endorsements. She is probably still most famous for her role on the sitcom Friends but has also managed to carve out a very respectable film career in the two decades. Jennifer Aniston was born in Sherman Oaks, California, and raised in New York City. She moved to Los Angeles in 1989 and worked a variety of part-time jobs before landing her first television roles.</p><p>From 1994 to 2004, she starred as Rachel Green on the long-running sitcom Friends, a role that turned Jennifer Aniston into a household name (and the basis of a popular haircut). She won an Emmy in 2002 and a Golden Globe in 2003. During the 2003 and 2004 seasons of the show, Aniston and her female co-stars each earned $1 million per episode, making them the highest-paid TV actresses of all time. Coinciding with and following her time on Friends, she has appeared in a variety of films, notably Bruce Almighty, Along Came Polly, The Break-Up, and the independent drama The Good Girl, which earned her praise in the critical media and hefty paychecks. She has continued to have success with the more recent films We're the Millers, Office Christmas Party, Netflix's Murder Mystery movies, and Apple TV's The Morning Show.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-277865 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/jennifer-aniston-1.jpg alt width=594 height=514 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-277865 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=wealth-milestones><strong>Wealth Milestones</strong></h2><p>After receiving an enormous salary bump ahead of the seventh season (as detailed below) Jennifer was instantly propelled to one of the highest-paid actresses in the world. She has ranked on the list every year since. She was the highest paid actress in the world in 2003, with $21 million in total earnings. Today she consistently earns $25-30 million per year.</p><h2 id=movie-earnings><strong>Movie Earnings</strong></h2><p>Between 1997 and 2011 alone, she earned $75 million from film paychecks. For much of that time she commanded $8 million per movie. One of Jennifer's highest film paychecks was the $10 million she made from 2011's Just Go With It.</p><h2 id=endorsements><strong>Endorsements</strong></h2><p>Jennifer is one of the most sought-after celebrity endorsers in the world. Over the years she has earned a fortune endorsing brands like L'Oreal, Smartwater, Emirates, Eyelove and Aveeno. Today Jennifer makes around $10 million per year from endorsements alone. She has also created six fragrances (as of this writing).</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-305862 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jennifer-Aniston.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-305862 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-friends-salary><strong>Jennifer Aniston Friends Salary</strong></h2><p>For the first season of Friends, each cast member earned $22,500 per episode. That works out to $540,000 for the first season. Their salaries were boosted to $40,000 per episode in the second season. That works out to $960,000 for the second season. Ahead of the third season when their contracts were up, the cast banded together to negotiate as a group. They ended up with a deal that paid $75,000 per episode of season three ($1.875 million for the season), $85,000 for season 4 ($2.04 million), $100,000 for season 5 ($2.5 million) and $125,000 in season 6 ($3.125 million). Ahead of season 7 the cast negotiated for a massive raise. They each ended up earning $750,000 per episode in seasons 7 and 8 ($18 million per season). For seasons 9 and 10, each cast member earned $1 million per episode. That works out to $24 million for season 9 and $18 million for season 10. If you total it all up, each cast member of Friends earned around $90 million in base salary alone from the show before backend bonuses and on-going royalties.</p><h2 id=friends-royalties><strong>Friends Royalties</strong></h2><p>As part of their 2000 contract negotiations, the cast was able to demand backend points on the show which would allow them to earn royalties off the show's sale into syndication. Up to that point, the only other TV stars who had ownership stakes in shows were <a href=# title="Jerry Seinfeld Net Worth">Jerry Seinfeld</a> and <a href=# title="Bill Cosby Net Worth">Bill Cosby</a>. Friends continues to generate north of $1 billion per year in syndication royalties and streaming deals. It has been reported that each cast member in some years can earn <a href=#>$10-20 million in royalties alone</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-329691 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jennifer-Aniston-1.jpg alt="Jennifer Aniston Net Worth" width=670 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-329691 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Vinnie Zuffante/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=apple-tv-salary><strong>Apple TV Salary</strong></h2><p>For her role on the Apple TV show "The Morning Show" both Jennifer and her co-star <a href=# title="Reese Witherspoon Net Worth">Reese Witherspoon</a> earned $1.25 million per episode. As of this writing, that's the fifth-highest amount of money ever paid to an actor on a per-episode basis.</p><h2 id=personal-life-relationships><strong>Personal Life and Relationships</strong></h2><p>In 2000, Aniston married longtime boyfriend <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> in an elaborate ceremony in Malibu. The two split in 2005, and Aniston has since been linked with a series of Hollywood actors including <a href=#>Vince Vaughn</a> and singer <a href=#>John Mayer</a>. For a number of years she was romantically linked to actor/writer <a href=# title="Justin Theroux Net Worth">Justin Theroux</a>. They began dating in May 2011, got engaged in August 2012, and were married in August 2015. But the couple split at the end of 2017.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In January 2012 Jennifer spent $20.1 million to buy a home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles. This house sits on 3.25 acres of property. Built in the mid-60s, the 8,500 square foot home sports four bedrooms, six bathrooms, another 1/2 bath, and open-plan design. Floor-to-ceiling windows allow in lots of light, and provide completely clear views of the ocean and the surrounding city. The substantial estate also holds a swimming pool, a separate guesthouse, and a private vineyard. Additionally, the estate has a large area for cars, and a series of walls that afford the owner almost total privacy.</p><p>In 2006, shortly after her divorce from Brad Pitt, Jennifer spent $13.5 million on a home in Beverly Hills which she proceeded to remodel from the ground up, at a cost of several million dollars. She sold this house in 2011 for $35 million.</p><p>Jennifer also owns at least $10 million worth of property in New York City. Jennifer's Manhattan apartment is one of 23 in an exclusive building. The unit spans more than half the whole floor at 2,873 square feet of living space. It has 3 bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms, with the master bedroom offering views of Gramercy Park. The whole condo is filled with floor-to-ceiling windows and vaulted ceilings reaching as high as 11.8 feet up. This spreads natural light across the hardwood floors throughout the home. Additional features include a wood-burning fireplace, spa-like bathrooms, a powder room, walk-in master closet and top-of-the-line Miele appliances. This building is part of the Gramercy luxury boutique hotel, which gives Jennifer Aniston access to the hotel's 5-star services and amenities. Included with her purchase are housekeeping, valet service, room service, butler service, catering, event planning, car detailing service, personal shopping and a delivery service. She also gets a free membership to the hotel's high-end David Barton Gym and Spa, and access to Gramercy Park, Manhattan's only private park. This list of services get thrown into the $11,000 monthly HOA fee.</p><p>In 2022, Aniston purchased a $15 million Montecito farmhouse from <a href=# title="Oprah Winfrey Net Worth">Oprah Winfrey</a>.
