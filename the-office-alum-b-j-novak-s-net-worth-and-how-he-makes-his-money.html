Novak was born in 1979 in Massachusetts. Novak was born into a prestigious family – his father was an acclaimed writer and worked as a ghostwriter for celebrities such as Magic Johnson. Novak was very intelligent as a child and attended the prestigious Harvard University after his high school graduation. He graduated from Harvard in 2001 and promptly moved to California in order to pursue a career as a comedian.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_46>Novak started performing stand-up comedy routines all over the state of California, and soon, critics and audiences alike began noticing his talent. The young comedian also started working as a writer and actor, appearing opposite Ashton Kutcher in one of the early seasons of Punk’d.</p><p id=par-5_47>After spending several years developing his talent through multiple industry jobs, Novak finally received his big break in the year 2005, when he was cast on a show that would go on to change his life as well as the way that people viewed television in general.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Biggest career roles</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-6_65>In 2005, B.J. Novak was cast as Ryan Howard on The Office. He went on to become one of the show’s most popular featured characters and appeared in the series all the way until 2013 when the iconic show went off the air. He was also one of the show’s writers, responsible for much of the hilarious dialogue and now-infamous situations on The Office.</p><p id=par-7_60>The show also began his long association with the popular writer/actor <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Mindy Kaling</a>. The two dated for a while, just as their characters in The Office did, causing many fans to not know where their romance really stood at the end of the series. These days, the two remain <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>good friends</a>. Novak is even the godfather of Kaling’s daughter, Katherine.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_78>In addition to his work on The Office, Novak has continued to write voraciously and has published several books. He has also branched out and acted in a number of films, including The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Knocked Up, Saving Mr. Banks, The Founder, Reign Over Me, and Inglourious Basterds. Still, Novak hasn’t left his television career behind and has appeared in a number of popular television shows over the past few years, including The Mindy Project and Community.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is B.J. Novak’s net worth?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-9_75>These days, B.J. Novak is busier than ever, with a wealth of new projects and writing gigs to work on.
