Pete Doherty is best known for being a co-frontman of the English rock band the Libertines, which he co-founded in 1997 with Carl Barât. He later launched the bands Babyshambles and Peter Doherty and the Puta Madres. Among his other activities, he paints, writes poetry, and acts, having starred in the 2012 historical drama film "Confession of a Child of the Century."</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Pete Doherty was born on March 12, 1979 in Hexham, Northumberland, England to military parents Peter, a major in the Royal Signals, and Jacqueline, a lance-corporal in Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps. He has Irish, Russian, and French ancestry. Doherty grew up with his sisters AmyJo and Emily in a number of army garrisons throughout Europe. While living in Dorset when he was 11, he began playing the guitar. After graduating from Nicholas Chamberlaine Comprehensive School, he attended Queen Mary University of London for a year.</p><h2 id=libertines><strong>The Libertines</strong></h2><p>With his London flat mate, fellow musician Carl Barât, Doherty formed the rock band the Libertines in 1997. The two served as co-frontmen, singing and playing guitar. In 2002, the Libertines had their breakthrough with their debut album, "Up the Bracket." However, the band's success was soon undercut by the behavior of Doherty, whose drug habit led to his estrangement from the Libertines. In 2003, he was put in prison for burgling Barât's flat. The pair reunited upon Doherty's release, and the band went on to perform at the Tap 'n' Tin pub in Chatham, Kent. Unfortunately, Doherty continued to struggle with substance addiction, leading to the disbanding of the Libertines in late 2004. The group reunited six years later to perform at various festivals. In late 2014, they signed a deal with Virgin EMI Records, and in 2015 released the album "Anthems for Doomed Youth." The Libertines went on to play tour dates across Europe.</p><h2 id=further-bands-collaborations><strong>Further Bands and Collaborations</strong></h2><p>While banned from the Libertines for his substance addiction issues in 2003, Doherty formed another rock band called Babyshambles. He enlisted former Libertine bandmate Steve Bedlow as a vocalist. The band ultimately released three studio albums between 2005 and 2013: "Down in Albion," "Shotter's Nation," and "Sequel to the Prequel." Babyshambles also released an EP entitled "The Blinding EP."</p><p>Before the disbanding of the Libertines in 2004, Doherty collaborated with fellow songwriter and musician Wolfman on the single "For Lovers," which reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart and earned an Ivor Novello Award nomination. Among his other music projects, Doherty formed the band Peter Doherty and the Puta Madres in late 2016. Joining him in the lineup are Drew McConnell, Jack Jones, Miki Beavis, Katia de Vidas, and Rafa. The band released its self-titled debut album in 2019.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-165388 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Pete-Doherty.jpg alt="Pete Doherty" width=395 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-165388 class=wp-caption-text>Ian Gavan/Getty Images</p><h2 id=solo-recording-career><strong>Solo Recording Career</strong></h2><p>As a solo artist, Doherty released his debut album, "Grace/Wastelands," in 2009. It was supported by the single "Last of the English Roses," his first as a solo performer. Doherty's second solo album was 2016's "Hamburg Demonstrations."</p><h2 id=other-media><strong>Other Media</strong></h2><p>Doherty has been involved in a range of other media beyond the world of music. In 2007, he released a poetry collection through Orion Books, exhibited his paintings at London's Bankrobber Gallery, and served as the face of <a href=# title="Roberto Cavalli Net Worth">Roberto Cavalli</a>'s fashion advertising campaign. The year after that, Doherty held another exhibition of his paintings, this time in Paris. His exhibition elicited criticism for glamorizing substance abuse, and was controversial for Doherty's use of his own blood in the artworks.</p><p>Dohery has also acted on screen, notably in the 2012 historical drama "Confession of a Child of the Century." Based on the novel of the same name by Alfred de Musset, the film stars Doherty and <a href=# title="Charlotte Gainsbourg Net Worth">Charlotte Gainsbourg</a>. It premiered in the Un Certain Regard section of the Cannes Film Festival.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-354391 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Pete-Doherty.jpg alt width=900 height=618 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-354391 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=substance-abuse-problems><strong>Substance Abuse Problems</strong></h2><p>Doherty has struggled with substance addiction for much of his life, and has been repeatedly arrested and jailed for drug-related offenses. His crimes have included drunk driving, automobile theft, possession of cocaine and heroin, and burglary. Doherty has had multiple stints in rehabilitation centers throughout his long battle to fight his problem. In a 2022 interview with NME, he claimed that he had been sober since late 2019.</p><h2 id=relationships><strong>Relationships</strong></h2><p>Doherty had a troubled and heavily publicized relationship with British model <a href=#>Kate Moss</a>, whom he dated from 2005 to 2007. After that, he was briefly engaged to Romanian-Canadian model Irina Lăzăreanu.</p><p>In 2021, Doherty married his first wife, his Puta Madres bandmate Katia de Vidas. From previous relationships with singer <a href=# title="Lisa Moorish Net Worth">Lisa Moorish</a> and model Lindi Hingston, respectively, Doherty has a son named Astile and a daughter named Aisling.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aiapGWjqa6zv46pnK2dXZm8qbHRrbBmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpete-doherty-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&text=Pete%20Doherty%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpete-doherty-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpete-doherty-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Pete%20Doherty%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpete-doherty-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Pete%20Doherty%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpete-doherty-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Pete%20Doherty%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpete-doherty-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&description=Pete%20Doherty%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./reddit-users-are-surprised-steve-from-fuller-house-went-from-hating-school-to-a-career-in-the-medi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Reddit Users Are Surprised Steve From 'Fuller House' Went From Hating School To a Career in the Medi">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jay-mohr-net-worth-how-much-is-the-actor-earned-in-his-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jay Mohr Net Worth: How Much is the Actor Earned in His Life?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
