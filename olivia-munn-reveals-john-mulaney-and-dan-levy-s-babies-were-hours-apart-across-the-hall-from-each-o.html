Mulaney and Levy have been close friends for years and have worked on one another’s projects. Munn shared video and photos from the babies’ first playdate, along with reactions of the completely smitten fathers.</p><h2 id=h-john-mulaney-and-dan-levy-s-babies-have-their-first-play-date>John Mulaney and Dan Levy’s babies have their first play date</h2><p id=par-3_49>Baby Malcolm and Penny are seen laying next to each other wearing adorable onesies as their parents provided <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">commentary</a>. At one point Malcolm’s arm went over Penny’s face. “Careful Malcolm,” can be heard in the background. “And she’s like ‘What’s happening?” Mulaney can be heard saying, “Rightfully so, Penny.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Mulaney-1.jpg><p id=par-4_52>Levy gently moved Malcolm’s outstretched arm away from his daughter’s face. The parents are heard laughing as Mulaney joked that his son’s arm will probably pop back up again. Levy captioned another photo, “Penny and her best/only friend Malcolm listening to us talk about the state of comedy and the citizen app.”</p><p id=par-5_50><a href=#>Munn also shared a sweet video</a> of the fathers joking with their newborns. “You smiling Malcolm?” Mulaney asked his son. “Hi, Penny.” Mulaney then takes Penny’s legs so she’s dancing, while Levy does the same to Malcolm. Mulaney added, “Yeah, you guys are young.” Munn captioned the photo, “Stage dads.”</p><h2 id=h-dan-levy-officiated-john-mulaney-s-wedding-to-anna-marie-tendler>Dan Levy officiated John Mulaney’s wedding to Anna Marie Tendler</h2><p id=par-6_70>Mulaney said in a previous standup that Levy officiated his <a href=#>wedding to Anna Marie Tendler.</a> He joked about how since he is Catholic and Tendler is Jewish they were <a href=#>married by a friend</a>. “My wife is Jewish, I grew up Catholic, so we got married by a friend. Being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families’ religions while confusing the elderly people at the wedding.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_31>He added a comment from one of the wedding guests. “‘What’s the name of the bishop?’ That’s actually stand-up comedian Dan Levy,” he added. Mulaney and Tendler have since divorced.</p><p id=par-8_63>While Levy is recognizable from his standup and was the executive producer of series like The Goldbergs, Levy often gets confused with the other actor/comedian Dan Levy. A fan <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> about the wedding after seeing Mulaney’s The Comeback Kid in 2017. He replied, “It was actually @danlevy not @danjlevy. We tried to get Dan J Levy but had to go with a backup.”</p><h2 id=h-they-work-on-one-another-s-projects>They work on one another’s projects</h2><p id=par-9_51>Mulaney was recently a guest comedian on <a href=#>Levy’s hilarious House Hunter‘s commentary,</a> House Hunters: Comedians on Couches series. Mulaney’s previous standup about House Hunters fit the episode perfectly. He even joked about how the husband on the show was slightly terrifying. “That meeting story was frightening and rude,” Mulaney joked.</p><p id=par-10_45>Levy also worked on Mulaney’s short-lived sitcom aptly named, Mulaney. “It’s exciting to work on the show,” Levy said during a 2014 interview with comedian Jeffrey Gurian of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Comedy Matters TV</a>. Gurian said, “John Mulaney is a spectacular guy. Just an amazing human being.”</p><p id=par-11_12>Levy also confirmed during the interview that he officiated Mulaney’s wedding.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-12_98>Mulaney and Levy have toured together too. Plus Mulaney interviewed Levy in 2016 about his standup special Dan Levy: Lion. Mulaney recalled how he and Levy also had the same contractor work on their houses at around the same time. “Speaking of designers, you and I had the same contractor work on our houses because we both got married, and we bought our first homes with our wives within the same couple years. And we both love our contractor. You text with our contractor just about five times a day, correct?” he asked Levy via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AV Club</a>.</p><p id=par-13_19><a href=#>RELATED: </a><strong><a href=#>John Mulaney Says He Was ‘More Sober Than Not’ During Seth Meyers Appearance in Sunglasses and Trench Coat</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS8rbXVophmpaWju26%2BxK%2BcmqSjYrewtM1mpK6kkaOyunnAp5tmnJGjeq2x1bKqZpqRl7amv4ywnKudXZ28tr7SZpipmaKpeqKv0aiqrGWknbJutMClo2aeoqS6brHAnJ9mp6SdsrN6x62kpWc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2folivia-munn-reveals-john-mulaney-and-dan-levy-s-babies-were-hours-apart-across-the-hall-from-each-o.html&text=Olivia%20Munn%20Reveals%20John%20Mulaney%20and%20Dan%20Levy%27s%20Babies%20Were%20Hours%20Apart%20%27Across%20the%20Hall%20From%20Each%20O&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2folivia-munn-reveals-john-mulaney-and-dan-levy-s-babies-were-hours-apart-across-the-hall-from-each-o.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2folivia-munn-reveals-john-mulaney-and-dan-levy-s-babies-were-hours-apart-across-the-hall-from-each-o.html&title=Olivia%20Munn%20Reveals%20John%20Mulaney%20and%20Dan%20Levy%27s%20Babies%20Were%20Hours%20Apart%20%27Across%20the%20Hall%20From%20Each%20O" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2folivia-munn-reveals-john-mulaney-and-dan-levy-s-babies-were-hours-apart-across-the-hall-from-each-o.html&title=Olivia%20Munn%20Reveals%20John%20Mulaney%20and%20Dan%20Levy%27s%20Babies%20Were%20Hours%20Apart%20%27Across%20the%20Hall%20From%20Each%20O" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2folivia-munn-reveals-john-mulaney-and-dan-levy-s-babies-were-hours-apart-across-the-hall-from-each-o.html&title=Olivia%20Munn%20Reveals%20John%20Mulaney%20and%20Dan%20Levy%27s%20Babies%20Were%20Hours%20Apart%20%27Across%20the%20Hall%20From%20Each%20O" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2folivia-munn-reveals-john-mulaney-and-dan-levy-s-babies-were-hours-apart-across-the-hall-from-each-o.html&description=Olivia%20Munn%20Reveals%20John%20Mulaney%20and%20Dan%20Levy%27s%20Babies%20Were%20Hours%20Apart%20%27Across%20the%20Hall%20From%20Each%20O" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./danny-gokey-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Danny Gokey Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./freak-show-s-dandy-dot-bette-love-triangle.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Freak Show's Dandy-Dot-Bette Love Triangle?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
