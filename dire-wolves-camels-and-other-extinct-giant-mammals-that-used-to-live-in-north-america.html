Their teeth weren't as long as smilodon and were serrated like a steak knife. Like the smilodon, they lived in North America during the Pleistocene.

While the smilodon went after tapirs (pig-like animals with trunks)<strong> </strong>and deer, scimitars preferred baby mammoths.</p><p class=premium>"Saber-tooth cats tend to get a lot of injuries in their lower back, which is consistent with this idea that they were ambush predators," Lindsey said. The smilodons would sit and wait before leaping onto a large animal and wrestling it to the ground.</p><p class=premium>"It's very easy to torque your back that way," Lindsey said.

They start showing up in the North American fossil record between 300,000 and 130,000 years ago.</p><p class=premium>The ancient bison, Bison antiquus, was 25% larger than those living today. Their territories included grasslands, woodlands, and wetlands from Canada to Mexico.</p><p class=premium>Another species of bison on the continent was the Bison priscus or steppe bison. A <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow><u>recent study</u></a> suggested modern bison — Bison biso — evolved from this species.</p><h2 class=premium>Why did they go extinct?</h2><p class=premium>Was it the changing climate, human interactions, or a combination that caused so many large mammals to go extinct around 10,000 years ago?</p><p class=premium>"That is something that scientists have been debating for about 70 years," Lindsey said. The climate was changing at the <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>end of the Ice Age</a> on a global scale. Humans were also spreading throughout the world.</p><p class=premium>"These two things are so closely tied in time, the climate changes and the <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>spread of human populations</a>, it's been really hard to say to what degree each of those factors was involved in the extinctions," Lindsey said.</p><p class=premium>Humans may have more of an impact than just hunting, too. A 2023 paper tied <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel><u>fires started by humans</u></a> to some of the extinctions in what is now California.</p><p class=premium>If that did have an impact on the animals in that region, the causes might vary for others. "Different ecosystems are going to have different parameters of what pushes them to the brink," Lindsey said. "But there is something about the combination of humans and an unstable climate or a rapidly changing environment that pushes ecosystems again and again towards tipping points."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png alt="A picture of a switch and lightbulb" itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Sign up for notifications from Insider!
