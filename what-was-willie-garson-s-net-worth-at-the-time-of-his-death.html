And Willie Garson’s net worth grew exponentially over time thanks to his iconic role. Unfortunately, Garson died on Sept. 21, 2021, at the age of 57, of cancer, but his legacy will live on.</p><p id=par-3_66>“Willie Garson was in life, as on-screen, a devoted friend and a bright light for everyone in his universe,” HBO/HBO Max told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">USA Today</a>. “He created one of the most beloved characters from the HBO pantheon and was a member of our family for nearly 25 years.&nbsp;We are deeply saddened to learn of his passing and extend our sincere condolences to his family and loved ones.”</p><p id=par-4_84>The <a href=#>Sex and the City show creator</a>, Michael Patrick King, provided a statement to USA Today regarding Garson’s death. “The Sex and the City family has lost one of its own, our amazing Willie Garson,” King said. “His spirit and his dedication to his craft were present every day filming And Just Like That …. He was there –- giving us his all –- even while he was sick. His multitude of gifts as an actor and person will be missed by everyone.”&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-was-willie-garson-s-net-worth-at-the-time-of-his-death>What was Willie Garson’s net worth at the time of his death?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Willie-Garson-1.jpg><p id=par-5_24>So, what was Willie Garson’s net worth at the time of his death? According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Garson’s net worth was $10 million.</p><p id=par-6_79>The publication notes Garson started amassing his wealth in 1986 when he was just 22 years old. But he truly got his big break in 1998 with Sex and the City. Garson played Stanford Blatch until 2004, and he was known for his flamboyant looks that felt perfect next to Carrie Bradshaw’s incredible looks. USA Today notes Stanford’s wedding in the <a href=#>Sex and the City 2 movie</a> was a highlight — and certainly a moment fans will never forget.</p><p id=par-7_64>As for Garson’s involvement in the reboot, And Just Like That …, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Looper</a> reports it seems he will definitely make an appearance in the first episode of the show. And additional set photos seem to prove Garson has additional parts in other episodes. It’s unclear how the reboot may wrap up his storyline, but fans will likely expect a tribute for the iconic actor.</p><h2 id=h-willie-garson-s-son-nathen-garson-survives-him>Willie Garson’s son, Nathen Garson, survives him</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Willie-Garson-Nathen-Garson.jpg><p id=par-8_55>While many fans are curious about Willie Garson’s net worth, we can’t forget the famous actor also had a child. Willie Garson’s son, Nathen Garson, came into his life in 2009 via adoption, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> reports. According to Garson, adopting Nathen was a “joint decision” they both made. Today, Nathen is reportedly about 20 years old.</p><p id=par-9_46>“We had a smooth transition because we both wanted this adoption,” he told People. “Fatherhood is what I always wanted it to be. I wanted it so badly and he wanted it so badly. I think often it can be difficult because it’s not that balanced.”</p><p id=par-10_47>Nathen posted a sweet tribute to his father on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>. “I love you so much papa,” he captioned his post on Sept. 21, 2021. “Rest In Peace and I’m so glad you got to share all your adventures with me and were able to accomplish so much.”</p><p id=par-11_20>And Just Like That …’s release date hasn’t been made official, but it seems the reboot will release in 2021.</p><p id=par-12_7>Check out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a> on Facebook!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqrjLopxmn5GnwLC60malnqxdrLyzwMdmq6KllWKxpq3ToWWhrJ2hfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-was-willie-garson-s-net-worth-at-the-time-of-his-death.html&text=What%20Was%20Willie%20Garson%27s%20Net%20Worth%20at%20the%20Time%20of%20His%20Death%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-was-willie-garson-s-net-worth-at-the-time-of-his-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-was-willie-garson-s-net-worth-at-the-time-of-his-death.html&title=What%20Was%20Willie%20Garson%27s%20Net%20Worth%20at%20the%20Time%20of%20His%20Death%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-was-willie-garson-s-net-worth-at-the-time-of-his-death.html&title=What%20Was%20Willie%20Garson%27s%20Net%20Worth%20at%20the%20Time%20of%20His%20Death%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-was-willie-garson-s-net-worth-at-the-time-of-his-death.html&title=What%20Was%20Willie%20Garson%27s%20Net%20Worth%20at%20the%20Time%20of%20His%20Death%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-was-willie-garson-s-net-worth-at-the-time-of-his-death.html&description=What%20Was%20Willie%20Garson%27s%20Net%20Worth%20at%20the%20Time%20of%20His%20Death%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./canva-s-latest-funding-round-boosts-founders-net-worth-to-6-5-billion-a-piece-and-they-plan-to-g.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Canva's Latest Funding Round Boosts Founders' Net Worth To $6.5 Billion A Piece - And They Plan To G">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-episode-that-affected-tom-selleck-the-most.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Episode That Affected Tom Selleck the Most">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
