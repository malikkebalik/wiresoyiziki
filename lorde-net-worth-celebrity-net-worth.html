In 2009, Lorde signed with Universal Music Group at the age of 13 and released her first studio album, "Pure Heroine," in September 2013. Her first EP, "The Love Club EP," included the song "Royals," which became a New Zealand hit in early 2013 and went on to top the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100 chart and become one of the best-selling singles of all time, selling more than 10 million copies. In 2018, "Royals" was ranked #9 on "Rolling Stone" magazine's "100 Greatest Songs of the Century – So Far" list.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Lorde was born Ella Maria Lani Yelich-O'Connor on November 7, 1996, in Takapuna, Auckland, New Zealand. Her mother, Sonja Yelich, is a poet, and her father, Vic O'Connor, is a civil engineer. Sonja and Vic became engaged in 2014 after dating for 3 decades and got married in 2017. Lorde grew up in Devonport with 3 siblings: older sister Jerry, younger sister India, and younger brother Angelo. She began performing in theater productions at the age of five, and as a child, she loved reading and showed an aptitude for English. By the time she was 14, she was editing her mother's Master's thesis and reading books far above her grade.</p><p>Lorde studied at Vauxhall School, Belmont Intermediate School, and Takapuna Grammar School, and in 2009, Lorde and friend Louis McDonald won the Belmont talent show and were invited to perform covers on Radio New Zealand's "Afternoons" show. McDonald's father sent recordings of Lorde and Louis to A&R executive Scott Maclachlan, which led to Lorde being signed to Universal Music Group.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In 2010, Lorde and McDonald began performing around Auckland as the duo Ella & Louis, and Lorde started taking singing lessons the following year. Lorde debuted her original compositions in November 2011, performing at the Victoria Theatre in Devonport. In December 2011, Lorde teamed up with singer-songwriter Joel Little to record "The Love Club EP," and she self-released it on Soundcloud in November 2012; it was commercially released in March 2013, and her full-length album, "Pure Heroine" debuted to critical acclaim in September of that year. "Royals" was included on both the EP and the album, and "Pure Heroine" also included the singles "Tennis Court," "Team," and "Glory and Gore." Lorde recorded 2 more EPs in 2013: "Tennis Court" and "Live in Concert."</p><p>After a bidding war, Lorde signed a $2.5 million publishing deal with Songs Music Publishing in November 2013. Lorde performed a cover of Tears for Fears' "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" on the 2013 "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire " soundtrack, and she performed 4 tracks on the following year's "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1" soundtrack as well as curating the album's track list. Lorde released her second album, "Melodrama," in June 2017 and lead single "Green Light" reached #1 on the New Zealand music charts. "Melodrama" was included on many lists of the year's best albums, and it debuted at #1 on the U.S. "Billboard" 200 chart. Lorde toured internationally for both " Pure Heroine" and "Melodrama," and she has performed at several concert festivals, including California's Coachella Festival and Sydney's Laneway Festival. Since 2108, Lorde has been a patron of MusicHelps, a charitable organization that is dedicated to changing the lives of New Zealanders in need through the power of music.</p><p>Lorde has named Billie Holiday, <a href=# title="Etta James Net Worth">Etta James</a>, <a href=# title="Cat Stevens Net Worth">Cat Stevens</a>, Fleetwood Mac, Bon Iver, The Smiths, Prince, <a href=# title="David Bowie Net Worth">David Bowie</a>, and many other artists as musical influences but says that her mother is her main songwriting influence. She also is inspired by several authors, including Kurt Vonnegut, Tobias Wolff, Sylvia Plath, and Walt Whitman. Lorde's musical style has been described as "electropop," "dream pop," and "indie-electro."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-301157 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lorde.jpg alt width=900 height=637 sizes="(max-width: 1469px) 100vw, 1469px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-301157 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Christopher Polk/Getty Images for Coachella)</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Lorde was in a relationship with photographer James Lowe from 2013 to 2016. In 2017, Lorde revealed that she holds dual citizenship in New Zealand and Croatia; her maternal grandparents were Croatian immigrants from the Dalmatia region. In her free time, Lorde enjoys quilting, photography, and watching movies.</p><h2 id=awards><strong>Awards</strong></h2><p>Lorde has earned more than 40 awards, including 18 New Zealand Music Awards, 2 Billboard Music Awards, 2 Grammys, 4 APRA Silver Scroll Awards, 3 World Music Awards, and an ASCAP Pop Award.

On the show, it is revealed that Lorde is Randy Marsh's alter-ego and that his hit song is "Push (Feeling Good on a Wednesday)," which is about using the women's restroom at work. After the first 2 episodes aired, Lorde tweeted that she thought it was cool to be featured on the show, and she later performed part of "Push" while being interviewed on New Zealand's TV3.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2016, Lorde paid NZ$2.84 million (USD$2.01 million) for a home in the Herne Bay area of Auckland; the home was built in 1900 and includes 4 bedrooms and a heated swimming pool.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70qKloJ2iqHytu9GdnGamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2florde-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&text=Lorde%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2florde-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2florde-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Lorde%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2florde-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Lorde%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2florde-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Lorde%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2florde-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&description=Lorde%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mark-zuckerberg-walls-in-his-116-million-kauai-paradise.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mark Zuckerberg Walls In His $116 Million Kauai Paradise">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./josh-groban-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Josh Groban Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
