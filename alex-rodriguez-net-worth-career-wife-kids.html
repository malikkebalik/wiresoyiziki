His contribution to baseball as a player and broadcaster has undoubtedly been immense. As of 2019, Alex Rodriguez’s net worth is <strong>$350 million</strong>.</p><p>All of this is the result of his hard work in the field of this game. Back in the days, Alex signed a 10-year contract with the New York Yankees, which was worth <strong>$252 million</strong>, a record in the history of baseball history. His annual income is not known, but he owns a Mercedes-Benz dealership and is an investor for eSports team NRG Esports.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rebecca Liddicoat Bio- Age, Height, Husband, Divorce, Net Worth, Wiki >></a></h4><p>Along with all of his net worth and deals, the talented player has appeared in commercials like Pepsi Cola. Guitar Hero World Tour, Nike, Radio Shack, etc.</p><h2>Wiki-Bio</h2><p><strong>Alexander Emmanuel Rodriguez</strong> was born on July 27, 1975, in Washington Heights. The name of his parents is <strong>Victor Rodriguez</strong> and <strong>Lourdes Navarro</strong>. There is hardly anything about the siblings, and as a result, he was a pampered kid.</p><p>Moreover, the famous baseball star belongs to American nationality and also holds a mixed ethnicity. His zodiac sign is Leo.</p><h2>Age and Body Measurements</h2><p>Alex was born in 1975, which makes him 44 years old. He stands at the height of 6’3″ and also weighs 101 kg. He’s tall and lanky looks tend to make him a man of robust personality and help him garner attention wherever he goes. His shoe size is 11.5, but his vital body statistics is not known to the general people.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Lund Bio, Age, Height, Career, Relationship, Net Worth, IG >></a></h4><p>Moreover, the tall height and also the strong looks well to support the brown color hair. Added to all of this shining pair of green eyes are the highlights of his physical appearance.</p><h2>Early Life and Education</h2><p>Alex was born in Washington and spent most of his childhood there with his family and siblings. This baseball player was a kid of great sports enthusiasm from a pretty age. His parents used to own the shoe shop, and his childhood was held well by struggles too.</p><p>For the educational background, Rodriguez attended Christopher Columbus High School and Westminster Christian School. After the successful completion of his schooling, this individual was provided with a baseball scholarship by the University of Miami, which was turned down only to accept the Seattle Mariners offer.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Rodriguez is a former baseball player who has been the ambassador of the game since the day of his play started. His debut came at the tender age of 18 for Seattle Mariners in 1994. His debut came against Red Sox at Fenway. Moving along the journey next year, his assignment came through for Seattle’s Triple-A club, and his recognition came through.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaitlyn Siragusa: Bio, Cosplayer, Model, Age, and Body Measurement >></a></h4><p>The fruitful association with Seattle came to an end in 2000, and there was a new chapter written with Texas Ranger from 2001 to 2003. When being signed by Texas Rangers, Alex received a whopping amount of <strong>252 million</strong> US dollars. The achievements of the man have been humongous as in 2003 he became the youngest 300 homers.</p><p>Beyond the stint with Texas Ranger, the big story came below as Rodriguez joined New York Yankees in 2004 and remained together till 2016. In between, the broadcaster didn’t play the 2014-2015 season.</p><p>There have been many injuries and controversies surrounding this player, but his charm, class, and grace have always been around for a lot of baseball fans to see. As of now, he is retired, but his contribution to the game is through broadcasting.</p><h2>Alex Rodriguez Wife</h2><p>Alex Rodriguez is a former baseball player who has made an excellent name for himself. Not only in the professional career, but his personal life is all full of ups and downs.</p><p>There are lots of women that have come and gone from his life. The first lady to appear in his love life was <strong>Cynthia Scurtis,</strong> who was a psychology graduate. Both of them walked down the aisle in 2002. To strengthen their marriage, both of them have kids <strong>Natasha Alexander,</strong> born in 2004, and <strong>Ella Alexander,</strong> who was born in 2008.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/alex-1239.jpg><p>But their thing didn’t go pretty well, and as a result, in 2011, they parted ways. Some of the sources suggest the fact that Rodrguez was in a relationship with <strong>Madonna</strong> in 2008 that brought the separation. Besides his first wife, other girls that have been his part of likes include <strong>Kate Hudson</strong> in 2009, <strong>Cameron Diaz</strong> in 2010-2011, <strong>Demi Moore</strong> in 2012, and <strong>Anne Wojcicki</strong> in 2017.</p><p>Beyond all of this, the best one is at this point when Alex is dating <strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong> since February 2017. We feel that this relationship will go on for some time, and there is hardly any news of any rift at this point.</p><h2>Social Media Reach</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Instagram</a>– 3.2m followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Twitter</a>– 1.25m followers</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57wKWcsWWipLGztcaunLNlnprBbsPOq6uhZZGcsm60xKKeoaxdmK6zscSrZLChlpp6rLXDrGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2falex-rodriguez-net-worth-career-wife-kids.html&text=Alex%20Rodriguez%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20Wife%20%26amp%3b%20Kids&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falex-rodriguez-net-worth-career-wife-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2falex-rodriguez-net-worth-career-wife-kids.html&title=Alex%20Rodriguez%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20Wife%20%26amp%3b%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2falex-rodriguez-net-worth-career-wife-kids.html&title=Alex%20Rodriguez%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20Wife%20%26amp%3b%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2falex-rodriguez-net-worth-career-wife-kids.html&title=Alex%20Rodriguez%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20Wife%20%26amp%3b%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falex-rodriguez-net-worth-career-wife-kids.html&description=Alex%20Rodriguez%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20Wife%20%26amp%3b%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./aretha-franklin-s-tough-childhood-reportedly-led-to-a-life-of-silent-suffering.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aretha Franklin's Tough Childhood Reportedly Led to a Life of Silent Suffering">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-one-thing-charlie-day-thinks-people-get-wrong-about-it-s-always-sunny-in-philadelphia.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The One Thing Charlie Day Thinks People Get Wrong About 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia'">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
