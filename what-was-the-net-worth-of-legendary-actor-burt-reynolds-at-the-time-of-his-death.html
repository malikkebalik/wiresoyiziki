He was 82.</p><p id=par-3_15>After the star’s death was confirmed by his manager, his family released the following statement:</p><p id=par-4_86>“My uncle was not just a movie icon; he was a generous, passionate, and sensitive man who was dedicated to his family, friends, fans, and acting students,” <a href=#>said Reynolds’ niece, Nancy Lee Hess</a>. “He has had health issues, however, this was totally unexpected. He was tough. Anyone who breaks their tailbone on a river and finishes the movie is tough. And that’s who he was. My uncle was looking forward to working with&nbsp;Quentin Tarantino&nbsp;[in&nbsp;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood] and the amazing cast that was assembled.”</p><p id=par-5_72>Burton Reynolds Jr. had a career many could only dream of as it spanned nearly six decades. His first movie role came in 1961 for a film titled Angel Baby. He then starred in several television shows including Gunsmoke and Hawk before returning to the big screen and playing the lead in films like&nbsp;Deliverance,&nbsp;<i>The Longest Yard,&nbsp;</i><i>Smokey and the Bandit</i>,&nbsp;<i>Semi-Tough</i>,&nbsp;<i>Hooper</i>,&nbsp;<i>Smokey and the Bandit II</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Cannonball Run,</i>&nbsp;<i>The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,</i>&nbsp;and Boogie Nights.</p><p id=par-6_78>In 1988, he married his second wife, actress Loni Anderson, but their union ended with a bitter divorce in 1993. Reynolds agreed to pay her one lump sum of $234,794 plus $15,000 per month in support.&nbsp;In 1996, he filed for bankruptcy, in which he cited $6.6 million in assets and $11.2 million in debts. After filing for bankruptcy he starred in 47 films and had an <a href=#>estimated net worth of $5 million</a> at the time of his death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/burt-75-e1536270916507.jpg><p id=par-7_22>Here are some of the reactions from other Hollywood celebrities who paid tribute to Reynolds after the news of his passing broke.</p><p id=par-8_50>“There are times in your life that are so indelible, they never fade away. They stay alive, even forty years later,” Sally Field said in a statement. “My years with Burt never leave my mind. He will be in my history and my heart for as long as I live.”</p><p id=par-9_18>“Rest in peace to a legend and a friend,” Reynolds’ Boogie Nights co-star, Mark Wahlberg <a href=#>wrote on Twitter</a>.</p><p id=par-10_57>Arnold Schwarzenegger called Reynolds one of his “heroes” and <a href=#>tweeted</a> that “He was a trailblazer. He showed the way to transition from being an athlete to being the highest paid actor, and he always inspired me. He also had a great sense of humor – check out his Tonight Show clips. My thoughts are with his family.”</p><p id=par-11_27>“My good friend has started a new journey. Rest in my peace my friend. I’ll never forget the wonderful times we spent together,”&nbsp;country singer&nbsp;Reba McEntire posted&nbsp;<a href=#>on Twitter</a>.</p><p id=par-12_15>Sylvester Stallone shared a picture&nbsp;of the two together on Instagram with a&nbsp;message about his friend.</p><p id=par-14_13>While Dolly Parton tweeted out her own photo and tribute to her co-star.</p><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/n5nL4D040v</a></p><p>— Dolly Parton (@DollyParton) <a href=#>September 6, 2018</a></p><p id=par-16_6>Follow <a href=# rel=noopener>The Cheat Sheet</a> on Facebook!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZq6aq12ptaZ5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8Gpec6fZKWdl5q7pa3RsmSam6Skv26u1KurZqqVrruwuMOsZJqsXam1pnnToqSeZZ%2Bbeqm10mabnpmknXupwMylZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-was-the-net-worth-of-legendary-actor-burt-reynolds-at-the-time-of-his-death.html&text=What%20Was%20the%20Net%20Worth%20of%20Legendary%20Actor%20Burt%20Reynolds%20At%20the%20Time%20of%20His%20Death%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-was-the-net-worth-of-legendary-actor-burt-reynolds-at-the-time-of-his-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-was-the-net-worth-of-legendary-actor-burt-reynolds-at-the-time-of-his-death.html&title=What%20Was%20the%20Net%20Worth%20of%20Legendary%20Actor%20Burt%20Reynolds%20At%20the%20Time%20of%20His%20Death%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-was-the-net-worth-of-legendary-actor-burt-reynolds-at-the-time-of-his-death.html&title=What%20Was%20the%20Net%20Worth%20of%20Legendary%20Actor%20Burt%20Reynolds%20At%20the%20Time%20of%20His%20Death%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-was-the-net-worth-of-legendary-actor-burt-reynolds-at-the-time-of-his-death.html&title=What%20Was%20the%20Net%20Worth%20of%20Legendary%20Actor%20Burt%20Reynolds%20At%20the%20Time%20of%20His%20Death%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-was-the-net-worth-of-legendary-actor-burt-reynolds-at-the-time-of-his-death.html&description=What%20Was%20the%20Net%20Worth%20of%20Legendary%20Actor%20Burt%20Reynolds%20At%20the%20Time%20of%20His%20Death%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./chris-d-elia-don-t-push-me-tour.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris D'Elia: Don't Push Me Tour">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./susan-mikula-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Susan Mikula Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
