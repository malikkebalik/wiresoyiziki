Although Brie occasionally attended a "Christian-Hindu hybrid church," she admits that her mother "always made sure" that her children knew they were Jewish. Her acting career began when she starting performing in stage productions held by the Jewish Community Center in Southern California.</p><p>After graduating from high school, Alison attended the California Institute of the Arts. She eventually earned a bachelor's degree in theater and departed from the California Institute of the Arts in 2005. Next, Brie attended the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow. After returning to California, the young actress worked as a clown at birthday parties and performed in various stage productions.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Alison's first major role came in 2006, when she booked a supporting role in the Disney sitcom "Hannah Montana." She followed up by joining the cast of "Mad Men" as Trudy Campbell, a role she held until the series ended in 2015. During this period, Brie also found time to appear in series like "My Alibi" and "Community." The latter role earned her widespread critical acclaim, and she was nominated for a Critics' Choice Award.</p><p>By 2010, Brie was considered being included in various lists of "hottest women in the world" by numerous publications. During this period, she hosted an episode of "Attack of the Show!" and appeared in the film "Montana Amazon." Another major film role came in 2011, when she starred in "Scream 4." Over the next few years, she continued to book roles in movies like "The Five-Year Engagement" and "The Lego Movie." Brie also took the opportunity to establish herself as a voice actress with roles in animated series like "American Dad!" and "BoJack Horseman."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-170326 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/GettyImages-163182835.jpg alt="Alison Brie" width=550 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-170326 class=wp-caption-text>Jason Kempin /Getty Images</p><p>After appearing in an episode of "Lip Sync Battle," Brie continued her film career with starring roles in movies like "Sleeping with Other People," "Get Hard," "How to Be Single," "The Little Hours," "The Disaster Artist," and "The Post."

The series helped Alison earn a number of award nominations for a Critics' Choice Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Golden Globe Award.

After starring in the 2020 film "Promising Young Women," she wrote, produced, and starred in the movie "Horse Girl."
