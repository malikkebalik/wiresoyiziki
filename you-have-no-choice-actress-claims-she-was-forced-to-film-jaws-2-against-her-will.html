Most fans would recognize her as the girl whose face showed absolute terror when her character — alone in a boat that had just been attacked by a shark that also devoured her boyfriend (rough day!) — is greeted by Brody (famously played by Roy Schneider). She screams “Sh-sh-sh-shaaark!” as the horrific occurrence that she witnessed many moments earlier replays in her mind. It also served to tell Brody that she’s clearly in shock and that there is indeed a shark that’s terrorizing the group of kids that includes his two sons.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=413 data-injectable=true>Dusenberry appeared on a YouTube channel called The Daily Jaws and gave a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">highly informative half hour interview</a>.</p><p data-characters=86 data-current-count=86 data-injectable=false>Early in the interview, the host asked, “How did you get the part of Tina Wilcox?”</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Dusenberry replied, “I was under contract to Universal Studios and so I was on call to go and do whatever they needed me on. I didn’t always have to audtion so in this case I didn’t have to audition. They just said you’re going to do Jaws 2.”</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true>She then claims that she told the studio, “‘I want to stay in L.A. and work and that’s not my thing, I didn’t see the first one’ and they said, ‘You have no choice. You’re on it.’ And I was like, ‘Wow.’”</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>Looking back on the experience, she recognizes that getting cast in a film without even needing to audition was “a privilege,” but that she was so against it at the time that she kept asking the studio, “Do I really have to go and do that? Do I really have to leave L.A. that long and be on location?” She explains that she “was trying to negotiate not doing it.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=178 data-injectable=false>Later in the interview, she says that before filming, she decided to finally see the first film which, quite ironically, she had avoided watching because she was terrified of it.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>In regards to her contract, it’s similar to how old Hollywood used to operate decades earlier. Actors were signed to studio contracts and worked on a variety of films. Now, actors are generally signed to do a single movie at a time and are usually not contracted to studios.</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false>Despite her initial hesitation, Dusenberry speaks highly of her time on the film, and pointed out that she was actually the oldest amongst those portraying the teenagers. In fact, she says she was “23 or 24” while filming.</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=607 data-injectable=true>“We became quite a family,” Dusenberry says of the cast, adding that many of them still see each other. She fondly looks back on her experience, speaks of it as “being a lot of fun,” and that “We spent a lot of time in the Gulf of Mexico on one boat or another and learning to sail,” though she says that they spent many days they just hanging out all day on the water.</p><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=172 data-injectable=false>The most humorous moment of the interview, though unintended, was when Dusenberry was asked what she thought of Jaws IV. She replied, “Yeah, sorry, I did not see that.”</p><p data-characters=1 data-current-count=173 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJosKitXZ2ut7GMp6Zmm5iktqSxjJqaraqVqMBur8uaoKarXai1pnnWmqpmnp%2BnsKawjK2mZp6ZobputsCwqmZqXZa0orXNrKtmoJWneri1y6Vm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fyou-have-no-choice-actress-claims-she-was-forced-to-film-jaws-2-against-her-will.html&text=You%20Have%20No%20Choice%3a%20Actress%20claims%20she%20was%20forced%20to%20film%20Jaws%202%20against%20her%20will&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fyou-have-no-choice-actress-claims-she-was-forced-to-film-jaws-2-against-her-will.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fyou-have-no-choice-actress-claims-she-was-forced-to-film-jaws-2-against-her-will.html&title=You%20Have%20No%20Choice%3a%20Actress%20claims%20she%20was%20forced%20to%20film%20Jaws%202%20against%20her%20will" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fyou-have-no-choice-actress-claims-she-was-forced-to-film-jaws-2-against-her-will.html&title=You%20Have%20No%20Choice%3a%20Actress%20claims%20she%20was%20forced%20to%20film%20Jaws%202%20against%20her%20will" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fyou-have-no-choice-actress-claims-she-was-forced-to-film-jaws-2-against-her-will.html&title=You%20Have%20No%20Choice%3a%20Actress%20claims%20she%20was%20forced%20to%20film%20Jaws%202%20against%20her%20will" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fyou-have-no-choice-actress-claims-she-was-forced-to-film-jaws-2-against-her-will.html&description=You%20Have%20No%20Choice%3a%20Actress%20claims%20she%20was%20forced%20to%20film%20Jaws%202%20against%20her%20will" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ajay-devgn-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ajay Devgn Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./would-you-pay-1-million-for-the-rolls-royce-phantom-serenity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Would You Pay $1 Million For The Rolls-Royce Phantom Serenity?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
