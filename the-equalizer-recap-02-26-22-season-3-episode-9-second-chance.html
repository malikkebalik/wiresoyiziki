Robyn McCall’s personal life was mixing with her professional life and she was readjusting as best as she could. It was just going to take some time for that to happen. It was still strange in the meantime to see her daughter go off to train with Mel or see her Aunt Vi getting Harry a gift for helping her out. Robyn didn’t know what to do about all of these changes. She was doing her best to work through them when she got a new case. She was approached by Tim Fells.</p><p>Tim Fells is an ex-con. He was a known safecracker. He got caught on the last job and he took the prison sentence without a fight. But after he was caught, he fell out with his brother. Tim and Shawn lost both of their parents young. They only had each other and Shawn felt betrayed when Tim chose a life of crime over him. Shawn never visited Tim in prison. Tim was out now and he wanted to prove to Shawn that he changed by staying on the straight and narrow when suddenly Randall entered the picture.</p><p>It was Randall Grayle’s crew that Tim was in back in the day. Tim hasn’t seen him since prison. He didn’t want to risk his parole or go back to prison and he was actually doing really well by starting over when Randall approached him at his job. Randall wanted Tim to pull off another job for him. He also wasn’t going to take a no. He had already grabbed Shawn and he was threatening to kill Tim’s brother if Tim didn’t do this job for him. Tim was the only known person to break into a very high-end safe. And so that’s why Randall wanted him on the job.</p><p>Tim was the only person he knew that could get into that safe with no problem. Randall needed that because he has everything timed just right and he couldn’t risk anything going against plan. But forcing Tim into this wasn’t enough for him, he expected Tim to be grateful for his cut. It didn’t seem to matter to him that Tim was only doing this to save his brother’s life. Randall expected gratitude. He told Tim to fix his face and all along Tim was working with Robyn to rescue his brother.</p><p>Robyn and her friends got close to rescuing Shawn. They found out where he was being stashed. They went there and searched the place and unfortunately there were a little too late because Shawn had just gotten moved. With their plan to rescue Shawn running late, Robyn told Tim that he was going to have to do the job for Randall. Which might be an issue because the cops were watching Randall. They’ve been after him ever since he killed a cop during one of his heists and so they’ve been listening in as well as watching from a van parked outside.</p><p>The cops were waiting to catch Randall on one of his heists. Robyn didn’t want Tim to get caught in the crossfire and so she spoke to Detective Dante. It was Dante who was looking into Randall. Dante was thankfully a good friend. Robyn told him about Tim’s situation and he was willing to give her enough time to do her thing. Robyn had Mel infiltrate the crew. She filled in for another guy. Mel even proved she deserved to stay and so Randall let her stay with them. And Mel had to ditch her listening device because Randall checked everyone for one.</p><p>Harry lost contact with Mel after that. He couldn’t reach Robyn because he knew she was going after Shawn and so he called Dante. Dante hadn’t known that the job was in action. He was waiting outside of an empty building while Randall was across town with his crew. But after he talked to Harry, he realized that the job was going on. He then used his contacts to check Randall’s phone records. He found out the guy he was doing the job with. He found out where the heist was and he went there in pursuit of Randall.</p><p>Randall meanwhile had been wrong about what kind of safe it was. It had taken Tim a lot longer to crack it and he almost died. His brother almost died. Luckily, Robyn found Shawn. He had needed medical treatment and so she rushed him to the hospital and once she dropped him off she went looking for Mel. Mel had gotten into over her head. Randall knew she was a plant after the cops arrived a little too fast to the scene. So, Randall pulled a gun on her. Tim stepped in. Tim fought with Randall over the gun while Mel was fighting off another guy and in that chaos Tim had gotten knocked out.</p><p>Randall then made a run for it. Dante found Mel and she told him to go after Randall, but he saw that she was in trouble and so he chose saving Mel over capturing Randall. Randall got away. There’s no way that they can get him now because he’ll probably leave the country. And that left Dante angry.</p><p>Dante could have arrested Randall before this. He chose not to because he trusted Robyn when she said they’d get Randall and she let him down and so he was angry with her. He was angry with himself. He was lashing out and Robyn didn’t know how to deal with it. Robyn couldn’t even celebrate with her family after Aunt Vi used her sleuthing skills to take down a racist appraiser.</p><p>THE END</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnpJ2ybrHQrpiloaqav26%2BxJyYqWVgZ3pzgoxraWarlZbAsLqMbGSeqJmovKWxjHJkrJ2TpLulecKhmKeblWQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-equalizer-recap-02-26-22-season-3-episode-9-second-chance.html&text=The%20Equalizer%20Recap%2002%2f26%2f22%3a%20Season%203%20Episode%209%20Second%20Chance&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-equalizer-recap-02-26-22-season-3-episode-9-second-chance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-equalizer-recap-02-26-22-season-3-episode-9-second-chance.html&title=The%20Equalizer%20Recap%2002%2f26%2f22%3a%20Season%203%20Episode%209%20Second%20Chance" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-equalizer-recap-02-26-22-season-3-episode-9-second-chance.html&title=The%20Equalizer%20Recap%2002%2f26%2f22%3a%20Season%203%20Episode%209%20Second%20Chance" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-equalizer-recap-02-26-22-season-3-episode-9-second-chance.html&title=The%20Equalizer%20Recap%2002%2f26%2f22%3a%20Season%203%20Episode%209%20Second%20Chance" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-equalizer-recap-02-26-22-season-3-episode-9-second-chance.html&description=The%20Equalizer%20Recap%2002%2f26%2f22%3a%20Season%203%20Episode%209%20Second%20Chance" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bliss-poureetezadi-parents-and-nationality-where-is-she-from-age-and-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bliss Poureetezadi Parents And Nationality  Where Is She From?
