Worth</h3><p>Multi-talented mathematician and hedge fund manager Jim Simons’s net worth is a whopping <strong>$22 billion</strong>.</p><p>Most of his wealth comes from his investment firm “Renaissance Technologies.”</p><p>“The Medallion Fund,” the company’s most successful investment portfolio, can be attributed to most of Jim’s fortune.</p><p>In January 2022, his firm managed around <strong>$50 billion</strong> in assets.</p><p>Since 1988, data show that Medallion’s statistical investment strategies have produced yearly returns of roughly 40%.</p><p>According to a source, Renaissance limits Medallion’s holdings at roughly <strong>$10 billion</strong> and distributes gains every six months.</p><p>Since its inception in 1988, the fund, which is closed to outside clients, has made trading profits totaling more than <strong>$100 billion</strong>.</p><p>This amounts to an average net gain between 1988 and 2018 of 39.1 percent or a total return of 66.1 percent.</p><p>Similarly, the company also oversees three additional funds, which as of April 2019, had a combined asset value of about <strong>$55 billion.</strong></p><p>Moreover, these funds are accessible to outside investors.</p><p>Approximately 70% of Renaissance is owned by Simons and three other partners, according to a 2014 Senate probe.</p><p>In 2005, he earned <strong>$1.5 billion</strong>, the most significant earning among hedge fund managers that year.</p><p>Similarly, he made around<strong> $2.8 billion</strong> in 2007, <strong>$1.7 billion</strong> in 2006, and <strong>$670 million</strong> in 2004.</p><p>In 2020, Jim was estimated to have personally earned<strong> $2.6 billion.</strong></p><h3>Financial Controversy</h3><p>Investors reportedly questioned Jim in May 2009 about the portfolios of Renaissance Technologies’ colossal performance gap.</p><p>Despite high fees, the Medallion Fund, which had only been open to then-current and former workers and their families, increased by 80% in 2008.</p><p>Meanwhile, The Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF), held by outsiders, lost a lot of money in both 2008 and 2009 as it fell by 16% in 2008.</p><p>Similarly, he was criticized in 2014 for using advanced basket options to disguise day-to-day trading as long-term capital gains.</p><p>By passing off Renaissance Technologies’ regular stock trades as long-term investments, the company could save more than <strong>$6 billion</strong> in taxes.</p><p>According to a 2015 New York Times article, Jim was embroiled in one of the year’s most significant tax disputes.</p><p>It was due to the fact that the IRS was looking into a loophole that his company used to save their investment of <strong>$6.8 billion</strong> in taxes over ten years.</p><p>In 2021, it was revealed that Jim and his coworkers settled the most outstanding IRS lawsuit in history by paying billions of dollars in unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties.</p><h2>Jim Simons’ Net Worth in
