Prince Harry is the son of <a href=#>King Charles</a> and <a href=#>Princess Diana Spencer</a> (Princess of Wales). Harry's paternal grandparents are the late <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a> and <a href=# title="Prince Philip Net Worth">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a>. His older brother, <a href=#>Prince William</a> became the heir apparent to the throne when their father became King upon their grandmother's death in September 2022.</p><p>Prince Henry Albert Charles David was born on September 15, 1984. His mother died when he was 12-years-old in a car crash after being chased by the paparazzi. As a result, Harry has had a lifelong aversion to the paparazzi. There have been a number of times, in Harry's younger days, where he got into scuffles with paparazzi following him.</p><p>By the time he was in high school, he started to gain a reputation as a party boy. He was caught smoking weed and drinking at 16. His father sent him to the Featherstone Lodge Rehabilitation Center in South London for a day in January&nbsp;2002 in an effort to scare him straight.</p><p>Harry spent 10 years in the Royal Air Force. As part of his military duty, he was deployed to Afghanistan. He did two tours of duty in Afghanistan. He retired from active military duty in 2015.</p><p>Prior to essentially leaving the Royal family in 2020, the vast majority of Harry's $30 million personal net worth came thanks to a trust fund set up by his late mother Diana. When Harry turned 25, he started getting annual dividends from investments related to Diana's fortune, which amounted to about $450,000 per year. At 30, he inherited half of his mother's fortune, estimated to be $17 million. He and his brother William also inherited their mother's jewels and jewelry.</p><p>As a royal, Harry does not have to pay out-of-pocket for his lifestyle. The Duchy of Cornwall pays for his travel, clothing, staff, and daily expenses. Harry also receives half of a $4.7 million allowance, Prince William and Kate receive the other half.</p><p>William and Harry also each received several million dollars when their great-grandmother died in 2002.</p><p>After exiting the Royal family, Harry and his wife Meghan Markle signed an estimated $120 million worth of production deals, notably with companies Netflix and Spotify. Harry also signed on to produce a series for Apple TV+ with <a href=# title="Oprah Winfrey Net Worth">Oprah Winfrey</a> about mental health.</p><p>They reportedly felt the need to sign the deals after being cut off financially from his family back in England. In his former life, Harry's father paid around $4 million per year to provide staffing and security for his son.</p><h2 id=what-prince-harry8217s-last-name><strong>What Is Prince Harry's Last Name?</strong></h2><p>The short answer is that for as long as he carries the title "His Royal Highness," Prince Harry does not have a last name. His children use the last name "Mountbatten-Windsor" and when he was in the army, Harry arbitrarily went by "Captain Harry Wales."</p><p>Members of the British Royal family do not have last names. More specifically, members who who are anointed with the "His/Her Royal Highness" naming convention, usually monarchs, princes and princesses, do not have last names. In Harry's case, his full name â€“ the name that is listed on his children's birth certificate under "Father" is:</p><p>"His Royal Highness Henry Charles Albert <a href=# title="David Duke Net Worth">David Duke</a> of Sussex"</p><p>Also FYI, his occupation on the same certificates is "Prince of the United Kingdom."</p><p>Interestingly, as of this writing Harry's children have not yet been deemed "HRH", so they actually do have last names. Thanks to a decree signed into a royal decree by Queen Elizabeth in 1960, all members of royal family who are not "HRH" use the last name "Mountbatten-Windsor." That is why Harry and Meghan's children are "Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor" and "Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor."</p><p>Why "Mountbatten-Windsor"? That last name is a mish-mash of two family names. Windsor is the last name Elizabeth's grandfather George V chose for his non-HRH descendants and Mountbatten was Prince Philip's maternal grandparents' last name.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-258856 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-950321634.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-258856 class=wp-caption-text>Victoria Jones WPA Pool/Getty Images</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>He was born Henry Charles Albert David on September 15, 1984 in Paddington, London, United Kingdom. Members of the royal family do not have last names. Prince Harry's mother and father separated in 1992. Their divorce wasn't finalized until 1996. Tragically, Princess Diana was killed in a car accident in Paris the following year. Prince William was 15, Prince Harry was 12.</p><h2 id=military-career><strong>Military Career</strong></h2><p>Though Prince Harry has had his share of negative attention in the media, he redeemed himself in 2005 when he entered into the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He joined the Alamein Company and completed officer training to be commissioned as a Comet (second lieutenant) in the Blues and Royals, a regiment of the Household Cavalry in the British Army. In 2008 he was promoted to lieutenant. The prince was deployed to Iraq in 2007, a move Prince Harry supported, saying, "There's no way I'm going to put myself through Sandhurst and then sit on my arse back home while my boys are out fighting for their country." Harry would not serve in Iraq, however, as the head of the British Army at the time, General Sir Richard Dannatt, feared he would be a 'high dollar target'. In his military role Prince Harry went as "Lieutenant Harry Wales".</p><p>During his military career, Harry earned about $50,000 per year.</p><h2 id=partying><strong>Partying</strong></h2><p>Harry has always had spirit and as such, been one of Britain's (and the world's) favorite royals. But there was a time where Harry was spinning out of control. In 2005, photos of Harry in a Nazi costume at a friend's birthday party surfaced. Harry issued a written apology for his horrible lack of judgment. It took a long time for this scandal to die down.</p><p>In August 2012, Harry learned firsthand that, despite the catchy tagline, what happens in Vegas does not stay in Vegas. TMZ obtained photos of Harry in Las Vegas, naked and cavorting with two naked women during a game of strip billiards. It was supposed to be a trip to relax. The London Olympics had just wrapped. Harry was due to return to his duties as the pilot of an Apache Attack helicopter. Instead, it turned into an international media frenzy.</p><h2 id=philanthropy><strong>Philanthropy</strong></h2><p>As Diana's son, he was raised with a deep philanthropic streak. Diana was known as the people's princess and she supported a number of charities, including those dedicated to people living with AIDS. Harry has his mother's charitable service and is involved with a number of charities. The closest to his heart are those that help former servicemen and women. In 2014, Harry created the Invictus Games, in which wounded, injured or sick armed services personnel and their associated veterans take part in sports including&nbsp;wheelchair basketball,&nbsp;sitting volleyball, and&nbsp;indoor rowing.</p><p>In 2017, Harry and Meghan Markle began working with Elephants Without Borders. They also registered their own charity foundation called the Sussex Royal The Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex which was changed to simply Archewell in April 2020. Archewell is also their hub for creative media ventures.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Prince Harry married <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> in 2018. Not long after they announced they were expecting their first child together. In May 2019, Meghan gave birth to a son named Archie, who is seventh in line to the British throne. In June 2021, they had a daughter, Lilibet. Harry is the godfather of five or six children total.</p><p>In January 2023, Harry released his memoir "Spare" from which he reportedly earned an advance of at least $20 million. It is the first of a four-book publishing deal for Harry and Meghan. He announced that $1.5 million of the book's proceeds were pledged to the charity Sentebale with $380,000 going to WellChild.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-306956 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prince-Harry.jpg alt width=900 height=614 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-306956 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Joe Giddins â€“ WPA Pool/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=diana-trust-fund><strong>The Diana Trust Fund</strong></h2><p>When Diana and Charles divorced, he paid her a $24 million settlement. That's the same as around $40 million today after adjusting for inflation. After her death, the money was put in trust for William and Harry to inherit on their respective 25th birthdays. By the time they both were 30, the trust had appreciated to the point that each son ended up inheriting $20 million.</p><p>Unfortunately for Harry, he will not benefit from a trust called the Duchy of Cornwall that has made his father extremely wealthy and will eventually make William extremely wealthy.</p><p>In 1337, King Edward III established a trust to benefit the heir apparent to the British throne. Today the Duchy owns a $1.3 billion real estate portfolio that produces $20-30 million in after-tax income every year for the Crown Prince. As long as Queen Elizabeth is sitting on the throne, Harry's father Charles is the beneficiary of the income. When Charles becomes King, William will be the beneficiary.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>After announcing their decision to step back from royal duties, Harry and Meghan first spent some time in Canada before leaping down to Southern California where they lived for several months at a home owned by <a href=# title="Tyler Perry Net Worth">Tyler Perry</a>. In August 2020, it was revealed that Harry and Meghan had purchased a home in Montecito, California, (near Santa Barbara) for $14.7 million. They bought the home with a $10 million mortgage and a $5 million cash down payment.</p><p>It was reported in June 2023 that Harry and Meghan officially moved out of the Frogmore Cottage that was gifted to them by Queen Elizabeth after their marriage. Earlier in the year, King Charles had requested they move out.</p><h2 id=netflix-deal><strong>Netflix Deal</strong></h2><p>On September 2, 2020, it was announced that Harry and Meghan had inked a five-year "mega deal" with Netflix. Through the deal, Harry and Meghan will launch a production company, through which they will ultimately create scripted content, documentaries and children's programming. It was reported that the deal could be worth as much as $150 million.</p><h2 id=spotify-deal><strong>Spotify Deal</strong></h2><p>In December 2020, it was announced that Harry and Meghan signed a three-year podcasting deal with Spotify worth $18 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6sbvLoquim5mWu7R70aiwmqSjZL2ztc2cnGagkae%2FunnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fprince-harry-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&text=Prince%20Harry%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fprince-harry-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fprince-harry-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Prince%20Harry%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fprince-harry-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Prince%20Harry%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fprince-harry-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Prince%20Harry%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fprince-harry-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&description=Prince%20Harry%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tmz-sofia-vergara-believes-her-stalker-ex-nick-loeb-is-trying-to-destroy-her-marriage.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="TMZ: Sofia Vergara believes her stalker ex Nick Loeb is trying to destroy her marriage">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./paul-mccartney-s-last-words-to-his-dying-wife-linda-mccartney-helped-her-gently-slip-away.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Paul McCartney's Last Words to His Dying Wife Linda McCartney Helped Her 'Gently Slip Away'">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
