His parents were Shoshana and Chaim, Jewish natives from Poland who had immigrated separately in the mid-30s before later meeting and marrying. Perlman originally got interested in the violin when he heard a radio performance using the instrument. When he was three years old, he tried to get into the Shulamit Conservatory, but was denied admission on account of being too small to properly hold a violin. Consequently, Perlman taught himself how to play using a toy fiddle.</p><p>At the age of four, Perlman contracted polio; since then, he has walked with crutches and leg braces, and performs while seated. Eventually, he was admitted to the Shulamit Conservatory, and then to the Academy of Music in Tel Aviv. At the latter institution, Perlman had his first recital. When he was 13, he moved to the United States to study violin under Ivan Galamian and Dorothy DeLay at the Juilliard School.</p><h2 id=career-breakthroughs><strong>Career Breakthroughs</strong></h2><p>Perlman first began receiving national recognition in the late 50s when he appeared on "The <a href=# title="Ed Sullivan Net Worth">Ed Sullivan</a> Show."

In 1999, Perlman released "Concertos from My Childhood," a collection of pieces famously used in violin pedagogy. He didn't put out another album until 2009, with "The Essential Itzhak Perlman." This was followed by "Eternal Echoes: Songs and Dances for the Soul," "Violin Sonatas," and "The Perlman Sound."</p><p>Beyond his solo work, Perlman released three albums with AndrÃ© Previn between 1975 and 1981: "The Easy Winners," "A Different Kind of Blues," and "It's a Breeze."
