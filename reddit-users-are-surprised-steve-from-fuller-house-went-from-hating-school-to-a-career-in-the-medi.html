Steve even followed DJ to Disney World after they spent too much time apart.&nbsp;When Steve was in high school, he wasn’t a “brain” like DJ.</p><p id=par-5_33>During season 6, this character was accepted into Daytona Beach University, a party school in Florida. DJ wasn’t happy for him for several reasons, the biggest being that they’d be so far apart.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_41>During the “A Very Tanner Christmas” episode, Steve told DJ that instead of attending the Florida college, he wanted to go to a local community college, get his grades up, and then hopefully get into a good school closer to home.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_36>DJ and Steve broke up shortly after, deciding that they were going on different paths, but eventually, they found their way back to each other. In Fuller House, fans see Steve Hale as an adult.</p><p id=par-8_25>While DJ became a veterinarian, Steve became a podiatrist. Knowing Steve’s history with school, though, some fans were surprised this is the career he chose.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-during-fuller-house-steve-hale-is-a-doctor>During ‘Fuller House,’ Steve Hale is a doctor</h2><p id=par-9_50>Decades later, fans were reintroduced to Steve Hale and DJ Tanner, thanks to the spinoff series, Fuller House. Even though Steve was briefly engaged to someone else, these two found their way back to each other. However, some fans still had a problem with how Steve changed into a doctor.</p><p id=par-10_26>“Wasn’t Steve super dumb in the original show,” one Reddit user <a href=#>asked</a>. “How did he become a doctor… My girlfriend is really worked up about this!”</p><p id=par-11_38>“I was wondering the same thing but I doubt it’ll be explained,” another Reddit user <a href=#>wrote</a>. “Maybe he hurt his foot wrestling and his podiatrist helped him and then suddenly he was really into being a foot doctor.”</p><p id=par-12_46>With DJ and Steve finally getting married, fans have seen the last of these characters in the Netflix series, Fuller House. Just like Full House, this comedy series has since come to a close, with DJ sharing with her family that her door is always open.</p><p id=par-13_23>Episodes of Full House are available on Hulu, while episodes of the Netflix spinoff Fuller House are available on the rival streaming platform.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAtbHVnmSfrZyhsrN5x6isrJ1dmbykwM6rZaGsnaF8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2freddit-users-are-surprised-steve-from-fuller-house-went-from-hating-school-to-a-career-in-the-medi.html&text=Reddit%20Users%20Are%20Surprised%20Steve%20From%20%27Fuller%20House%27%20Went%20From%20Hating%20School%20To%20a%20Career%20in%20the%20Medi&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2freddit-users-are-surprised-steve-from-fuller-house-went-from-hating-school-to-a-career-in-the-medi.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2freddit-users-are-surprised-steve-from-fuller-house-went-from-hating-school-to-a-career-in-the-medi.html&title=Reddit%20Users%20Are%20Surprised%20Steve%20From%20%27Fuller%20House%27%20Went%20From%20Hating%20School%20To%20a%20Career%20in%20the%20Medi" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2freddit-users-are-surprised-steve-from-fuller-house-went-from-hating-school-to-a-career-in-the-medi.html&title=Reddit%20Users%20Are%20Surprised%20Steve%20From%20%27Fuller%20House%27%20Went%20From%20Hating%20School%20To%20a%20Career%20in%20the%20Medi" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2freddit-users-are-surprised-steve-from-fuller-house-went-from-hating-school-to-a-career-in-the-medi.html&title=Reddit%20Users%20Are%20Surprised%20Steve%20From%20%27Fuller%20House%27%20Went%20From%20Hating%20School%20To%20a%20Career%20in%20the%20Medi" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2freddit-users-are-surprised-steve-from-fuller-house-went-from-hating-school-to-a-career-in-the-medi.html&description=Reddit%20Users%20Are%20Surprised%20Steve%20From%20%27Fuller%20House%27%20Went%20From%20Hating%20School%20To%20a%20Career%20in%20the%20Medi" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sheila-johnson-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sheila Johnson Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pete-doherty-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pete Doherty Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
