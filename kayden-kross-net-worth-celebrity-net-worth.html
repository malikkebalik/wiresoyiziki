Kayden Kross began working as a stripper in order to earn enough money to purchase her own horse. She went on to attend California State University â€“ Sacramento and signed a contract with Vivid Video in her senior year. She chose not to re-sign with Vivid the following year, and instead signed with Adam & Eve. This proved to be a good move and she quickly became a fan favorite.

She subsequently kept the pony for eight months.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>While working as a stripper, Kross was noticed and contacted by an agent. Through that relationship, she started booking modeling opportunities in adult magazines. A few years later, she signed a contract with Vivid, an adult entertainment company. While with Vivid, she made the adult films "Kayden's First Time," "Hard Time," and "Be Here Now."</p><p>She was unhappy with her contract with Vivid and decided to become a free agent a year later, deciding not to renew with Vivid. After a month of being a free agent she signed an exclusive contract with Adam & Eve. In September of 2008, she was named "Penthouse" Pet of the Month. The same month, she launched her own website and blog. She additionally began writing regular contract for other adult industry gossip blogs.</p><p>In January of 2010, Kross became exclusive to Digital Playground under a multi-year contract. Her first film with the company, "The Smiths," became a chart-topper and remains one of her best sellers. She was later given the lead role in "Body Heat," during her third month in the contract. For her role in the film, she won a number of adult film industry awards.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-236912 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Kayden-Kross.jpg alt="Kayden Kross" width=594 height=448 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-236912 class=wp-caption-text>Ethan Miller/Getty Images</p><p>In 2010, she hosted the AVN Awards show along with porn actress Kirsten Price and comedian Dave Atell. She also starred in the 2010 AVN Best Feature "The 8th Day" and portrayed the role of <a href=# title="Elin Nordegren Net Worth">Elin Nordegren</a>, the wife of <a href=# title="Tiger Woods Net Worth">Tiger Woods</a>, in the film "Tyler's Wood." In 2012, she hosted the Xbiz awards. In 2019, she launched Deeper, a channel of Vixen Media Group, that films its own adult content.</p><p>In addition to her work in the porn and adult film industry, she has made several appearances in mainstream media. She has appeared in the FX comedy series "The League" and also the G4 reality series "The Block." Additionally, she has had a role in the series "Family Jewels." In 2011, she was cast as Tara in the drama film "Blue Dream." She briefly also co-hosted the videocast, "Kayden's Review," for Triggla TV along with Dane Hanson. From 2012 to 2013, she was cast as a main character in the web series "Girl/Girl Scene." She also hosted her own weekly call-in show, "Krossfire" on Playboy Radio. In 2013, she appeared in "Breaking Bad."

She writes regular columns for publications like "Complex" and "XBIX." She has also published a story in the 2012 short story collection "Forty Stories: New Writing from Harper Perennial."</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Kross has had a few problems with the law resulting from an incident which occurred in 2008, when Kross was 23. She was charged with grand theft and violations of the California Civil Code, involving contracts for purchases of home equity mortgages. In July of 2009, the grand-theft charge was dismissed and the real-estate fraud charge was reduced to a misdemeanor. She pleaded no contest to the resulting charges. She was sentenced to one day in custody and three years of probation. She has later stated that her involvement in the incident was related to her youth and her being scammed herself by the broker and mortgage lender she was working with.</p><p>Kross is in a relationship with <a href=#>Manuel Ferrara</a>, a French pornographic actor. They had a daughter together in 2014.</p><p>In 2013, Ferrara asked Kross to no longer perform with other male actors, though he continues to shoot scenes with other women. They have acknowledged the seeming double standard in this arrangement but have stated that it works for them. Kross also is able to veto any female performer that she does not wish Ferrara to work with. He has additionally stated that he would stop performing altogether if asked.</p><p>Kross has used her platform to advocate for various causes in the adult film industry. She testified against a proposed tax in California that would negatively affect producers and distributors of adult entertainment in 2008. She also appeared on the show "Stossel" in 2012 to discuss issues affecting the adult entertainment industry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7zKibnqSjZLiixcOepWajoqTAtHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkayden-kross-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&text=Kayden%20Kross%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkayden-kross-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkayden-kross-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Kayden%20Kross%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkayden-kross-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Kayden%20Kross%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkayden-kross-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Kayden%20Kross%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkayden-kross-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&description=Kayden%20Kross%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kenny-loggins-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kenny Loggins Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-to-get-a-single-dorm-room-in-college-because-sometimes-you-just-need-your-space.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How To Get A Single Dorm Room In College Because Sometimes You Just Need Your Space">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
