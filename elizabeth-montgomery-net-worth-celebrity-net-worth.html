The two married in March 1954 and divorced in August 1955. Montgomery then married actor Gig Young on December 28, 1956, and they divorced in early 1963. She wed director/producer William Asher on October 26, 1963, and they welcomed daughter Rebecca and sons William Jr. and Robert before divorcing in 1974 due to Elizabeth's affair with "Bewitched" director Richard Michaels. The affair led to the end of the series since Asher also worked on the show, both as a director and producer. Montgomery married actor Robert Foxworth on January 28, 1993, after nearly two decades of living together, and they remained together until her death just over two years later. Elizabeth was a Democrat, feminist, and gay rights activist, and she was an advocate for the disabled community and AIDS research. In 1992, Montgomery and her former "Bewitched" husband Dick Sargent served as grand marshals of the Los Angeles Gay Pride Parade.

She was later diagnosed with colon cancer that had spread to her liver, and she chose to spend her last months at home instead of in the hospital. Eight weeks after the diagnosis, Elizabeth died at her Beverly Hills home on May 18, 1995, at the age of 62. A month later, a memorial service took place at Beverly Hills' Canon Theatre. <a href=# title="Herbie Hancock Net Worth">Herbie Hancock</a> performed at the service, and her widower, Robert Foxworth, read sympathy cards he had received from fans.

In 2005, a bronze statue of Montgomery as her "Bewitched" character was erected in the town of Salem, Massachusetts, which was, of course, the location of the Salem witch trials in the late 1600s.</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>Montgomery was nominated for nine Primetime Emmys: Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role for "The Untouchables" (1961), Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Comedy Series for "Bewitched" (1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, and 1970), Best Lead Actress in a Drama for "A Case of Rape" (1974), Outstanding Lead Actress in a Special Program – Drama or Comedy for "The Legend of Lizzie Borden" (1975), and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series for "The Awakening Land" (1978).
