An 8-year-old may have come up with an idea for a business, but it's most likely mom or dad doing most of the work.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>But 14-year-old Noah Cahoon, CEO of the toy company Paper Box Pilots, is not merely a PR prop for his dad Brian's business. They're a father-son duo from Salt Lake City learning how to operate a small business together, with Brian letting Noah have the final say in the direction of the company.</p><p>The Cahoons appear on the latest sixth-season episode of ABC's hit pitch show "Shark Tank," when Noah, who was age 13 at the time of filming, makes a deal with investor Kevin O'Leary, a.k.a. <span>"Mr. Wonderful,"</span>&nbsp;without the advice of his dad.</p><p>Brian is a senior sales consultant at Oracle who had previously set aside his dream of starting a business when he started a family.</p><p>"When Noah was born, I was getting my MBA. I've always wanted to be an entrepreneur, but when I brought home that little guy — it's a feeling of responsibility that you have to be careful. And I never got the chance to take that risk," he tells the investors.</p><p>Advertisement</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image image-figure-float-right float-md-right" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><a class=image-click-enlarge href=# data-click-enlarge data-credit-href data-component-type=click-to-enlarge rel=nofollow data-analytics-product-module=body_link></a><span class=image-source-caption>Milo Cahoon serves as the company's "Chief Fun Officer." <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>"Shark Tank"/ABC</span></span></figure><p>Brian and Noah used to make designs for airplanes they made out of empty cardboard boxes when Noah was little. Last year Noah, an Eagle Scout, decided that they could <span>not only </span>start printing out designs for his 6-year-old brother Milo, but they could start selling those designs to retailers.</p><p>Brian had an opportunity to become the entrepreneur he always wanted to be while giving his ambitious son a business education before he even entered high school.</p><p>He tells the Sharks that he wants to teach Noah that there's not a single path in life and that he doesn't need to pursue a career where his main goal is to rise up a corporate ladder.</p><p>Brian tells the investors he treats Noah as a real CEO. In the first eight months of Paper Box Pilots they've made just $7,500 in sales from their online shop and small independent retailers, but the Cahoons say that Noah has been involved in every sale and every design and production decision.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>"What a great education," investor Lori Greiner says.</p><p class="content-recommendations-title headline-bold ignore-typography">Related stories</p><p>The Cahoons come to the Sharks looking for $35,000 in return for 25% equity and a partnership with a Shark who can mentor them to accelerated growth.</p><p>Investors Mark Cuban and Greiner both express admiration for the father-son team, but Cuban thinks the toy industry is not his forte and Greiner thinks the business isn't scalable.</p><p>O'Leary, however, does know the toy industry. He struck gold when he sold children's software maker The Learning Company to Mattel in 1999 for nearly $4 billion.</p><p>Advertisement</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image image-figure-float-left float-md-left" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><a class=image-click-enlarge href=# data-click-enlarge data-credit-href data-component-type=click-to-enlarge rel=nofollow data-analytics-product-module=body_link></a><span class=image-source-caption>Kevin O'Leary offers capital and his toy industry expertise to the Cahoons — in exchange for half the company. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>"Shark Tank"/ABC</span></span></figure><p>He thinks that he can use his industry connections to make Paper Box Pilots ride an anti-technology trend in toys and take off. He offers $35,000 for a full half of the company, as long as the Cahoons start offering pre-made toy boxes in addition to the decal kits they built the business on.</p><p>Investor Robert Herjavec makes the same offer as O'Leary, with the suggestion that he has a perfect way to package the toys to make a ton of money. Investor Barbara Corcoran then says that as long as the Cahoons start making more girl-friendly toys, she's offering $35,000 for a 35% stake because "it sounds cool!" Herjavec ups his deal to $50,000 for 50% equity with the extra selling point that he's "the fun Shark!"</p><p>The Sharks look to the Cahoons to make a decision. Brian asks for a little more direction from the investors, but Corcoran stops him, warning that <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>it's dangerous to push when you've been given a rock-solid offer</a>&nbsp;—&nbsp;or in this case three of them.</p><p>"All I can say," Brian tells Noah, "<span>is&nbsp;</span>you're the CEO, and it's ultimately your decision." Noah gets nervous and asks his dad under his breath which investor he should pick, but all Brian offers is: "Who do you think would be the best mentor?"</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Noah decides to hand over 50% of his company to O'Leary so that he can take his entrepreneurial education to the next level with O'Leary as his guide and his father by his side.</p><p>A quick look at the website shows that they're taking Corcoran's advice and have started marketing more to girls, though they still have yet to release pre-made toys. O'Leary will likely take care of that.</p><p>You can <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>watch the full episode on ABC.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufonxyf4yynJqqXaS5pXnPmqeeql2XvLl5z6KjqKyjYrCmu4yopWarmJa%2FrHnTmqWkZWJlfnV5kGk%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f13-year-old-paper-box-pilots-ceo-on-shark-tank.html&text=13-Year-Old%20Paper%20Box%20Pilots%20CEO%20on%20Shark%20Tank&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f13-year-old-paper-box-pilots-ceo-on-shark-tank.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f13-year-old-paper-box-pilots-ceo-on-shark-tank.html&title=13-Year-Old%20Paper%20Box%20Pilots%20CEO%20on%20Shark%20Tank" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f13-year-old-paper-box-pilots-ceo-on-shark-tank.html&title=13-Year-Old%20Paper%20Box%20Pilots%20CEO%20on%20Shark%20Tank" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f13-year-old-paper-box-pilots-ceo-on-shark-tank.html&title=13-Year-Old%20Paper%20Box%20Pilots%20CEO%20on%20Shark%20Tank" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f13-year-old-paper-box-pilots-ceo-on-shark-tank.html&description=13-Year-Old%20Paper%20Box%20Pilots%20CEO%20on%20Shark%20Tank" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./malik-yoba-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Malik Yoba Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./to-him-i-was-always-a-little-girl.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'To Him I Was Always a Little Girl'">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
