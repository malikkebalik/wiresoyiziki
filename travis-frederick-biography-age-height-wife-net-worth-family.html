He was inactive for the first four games before inevitably being placed on the reserve/non-football illness list on October 6, 2018.</p><p>On August 22, 2018, Frederick was diagnosed with Guillain–Barré syndrome.</p><p>On December 19, 2017, Frederick was named to his fourth straight Pro Bowl alongside tackle <a href=#>Tyron Smith</a> and guard <a href=#>Zack Martin</a> for the second straight year.</p><p>On August 13, 2016, Frederick signed a six-year, $56.4 million contract extension with the Cowboys, making him the highest-paid center in the league.</p><p>Before the start of the 2016 season, Frederick was named one of the five team captains. That year, Frederick helped pave the way for rookie running back <a href=#>Ezekiel Elliott</a> to the NFL rushing yards leader and his first Pro Bowl while protecting rookie quarterback <a href=#>Dak Prescott</a> to his first Pro Bowl as well. He was named to his third straight Pro Bowl and was named First-team All-Pro, both honors being shared with fellow Cowboy offensive linemen <a href=#>Tyron Smith</a> and <a href=#>Zack Martin</a>. He was also ranked 87th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017 as the only center in the list.</p><p>In 2015, he had to work with four different starting quarterbacks with varying degrees of knowledge of the team's offense, which required him to make more protection calls. He was named to his second Pro Bowl.</p><p>Frederick attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and played for the Wisconsin Badgers football team from 2009 to 2012. After graduating high school early to participate in spring practice, Frederick became the first true freshman in Badgers history to start a season-opening game on the offensive line, when he lined up at center against Northern Illinois. An ankle injury in week 2 knocked him out of the starting lineup, but he returned for the final two games, at left guard, after center <a href=#>Peter Konz</a> was sidelined (blood clots) and <a href=#>John Moffitt</a> was moved to center. For the season, he played in five games, starting four (two at center and two at left guard).</p><p>Considered the best center in his class by <a href=#>Mel Kiper Jr.</a> of ESPN, Frederick decided to enter the 2013 NFL Draft as an underclassman. He was projected to be a second- to third-round selection.</p><p>In the 2013 NFL Draft, the Dallas Cowboys traded down in the first round with the San Francisco 49ers in exchange for a third-round pick (used to draft Terrance Williams). In the first round, the team selected Frederick after eight offensive linemen were drafted before him. This decision caused a stir in the media because it was not only seen as a reach, but the trade was also criticized for bringing poor compensation after moving down 13 positions.</p><p>Following Konz's departure for the 2012 NFL Draft, Frederick was moved to center his junior season. He started all 13 games at center and was named a first-team All-American by Pro Football Weekly.</p><p>In order to preserve a year of Frederick's NCAA eligibility, Wisconsin coaching staff decided to redshirt him in 2010. In his redshirt sophomore season, Frederick replaced <a href=#>John Moffitt</a>, starting 11 of 13 games at left guard. For two games, he had to substitute for <a href=#>Peter Konz</a> at center.</p><p>A native of Sharon, Wisconsin, Frederick attended Big Foot High School in Walworth, Wisconsin, where he was an all-state two-way lineman. He helped his high school team to second place in the 2008 WIAA Division 4 state playoffs.</p><p>Frederick was also on Big Foot's track team. He finished second in the shot put at the 2008 'BDN' Invite, with a throw of 15.23 meters (50&nbsp;ft 0&nbsp;in). He took silver second in the discus throw at the 2008 WIAA Sectional Championships, with a throw of 49.30 meters (161&nbsp;ft 9&nbsp;in).</p><p>Travis Frederick (born March 18, 1991) is a former American football center who played his entire seven-year career for the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League. He played college football at Wisconsin and was drafted 31st overall by the Cowboys in the first round of the 2013 NFL Draft. In his time as a Cowboy he was elected to 5 Pro Bowls and he was an All-Pro in 2014, 2015 and 2016.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfqb%2BiwsisZJ%2BqlZmys7XCpA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftravis-frederick-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&text=Travis%20Frederick%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftravis-frederick-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftravis-frederick-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&title=Travis%20Frederick%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftravis-frederick-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&title=Travis%20Frederick%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftravis-frederick-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&title=Travis%20Frederick%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftravis-frederick-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&description=Travis%20Frederick%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./did-oppenheimer-ever-win-a-nobel-prize.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Oppenheimer ever win a Nobel Prize?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-billionaire-denim-impresario-who-lives-like-a-rock-star.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Billionaire Denim Impresario Who Lives Like A Rock Star">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
