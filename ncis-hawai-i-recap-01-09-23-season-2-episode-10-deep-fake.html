Special Agent in Charge Jane Tennant, NCIS Medical Examiner Jimmy Palmer, and Special Agent Sam Hana. Those three were taken from Virginia and put on a plane.</p><p>They didn’t know where they landed at first. But they were able to determine the location from various things they could detect. Like the call to prayer was played too frequently to actually be in the Middle East. Like the scent of the air had a hit of jasmine. Like how the show of force by their abductors were really just that. A show. The abductors were actually the CIA.</p><p>The hint of jasmine meant they were on Hawaii. The thugs that wanted to question them were literally on the same side as them. It was just the DOD, that wanted to cover themselves after classified Pentagon files were stolen, didn’t want to go through the proper. They didn’t want to go through Director Vance.</p><p>Its why they kidnapped a member from the Hawaii office, the LA office, and the Virginia office. The CIA wanted to know which team found out what and how its all connected to known terrorist Simon Williams. Williams was guilty of possibly everything one can imagine. And all the federal agencies were after him.</p><p>The CIA had abducted the three people on domestic soil where they didn’t have the jurisdiction. They even had the nerve to say they did it for the NCIS Agents’ own good. The woman claiming to be CIA Officer Melina Devlin told the trio that Simon Williams had spies on the inside of government.</p><p>He was allegedly spying on NCIS and he posed a threat to them and that’s why they were taken. But Tennant got one phone call before she was interrogated about Simon Williams. She called Parker to find out that he was in Hawaii and that he himself was also talking to a woman claiming to be CIA Officer Melina Devlin.</p><p>There couldn’t be two Melina Devlins. So, someone was lying, but which one? The one interrogating Tennant or the one that showed up at the Hawaii field office demanding access to their files. The one with Parker was interested when Simon Williams’s man showed up dead on Hawaii.</p><p>The dead man was identified as Mel Cano. Tennant’s team along with Special Agent Parker was investigating why he was killed, what his connection to everything else that happened, and how was Professor Harding involved? Tennant and Parker both fought back against the two Melinas. And while Parker’s got away, Tennant was able to arrest hers.</p><p>Tennant, Sam and Jimmy returned to Hawaii NCIS headquarters with their prisoners. Tennant’s Melina was claiming to be the real Melina. She said that the other woman was actually Morgan Miller. A contractor within the CIA. Melina claimed that Morgan Miller might be dirty and actually works for Simon Williams. She demanded to talk to her supervisor, but no one wanted to trust her around a phone. Parker was tasked by Director Vance to return to Virginia with Melina in custody while back on Hawaii Tennant was following up on Mel Cano’s murder. She connected his death to someone who only existed on paper.</p><p>His name was Norman Dell. He disappeared. But Tennant later found him. Tennant had gotten one piece of information from Melina that was crucial. She found out that CIA operatives use a site known as Haven LTD to get false backgrounds and fake papers proving they were someone else. It was located on Hawaii. Tennant and Jesse went there and there they found Norman Dell. When they questioned him to see if he was Simon Williams, he admitted they were standing in Simon Williams. Simon Williams isn’t a person. It’s a program. It’s a CIA assassin program that officially got shut down back in 1993 when a new administration came into power.</p><p>But suddenly, after a few years, someone restarted the program. This time they weren’t just killing enemies of the American government. They were also killing friendlies. Someone had found out about the program and activated it again to get CIA contractors to kill for them. Its like the guy that died in Virginia said before he passed. They were all Simon Williams. Norman Dell was a part of the original program with Professor Dale Harding. Everyone else in the program was slowly being killed off because the DOD had opened an investigation into the program and there were going to be hearings.</p><p>Norman Dell found out people were dying. He went to the Simon Williams bunker to destroy files and help keep one other person involved alive. And that’s where Tennant and Jesse found them. And that’s where Morgan Miller found them.</p><p>Norman Dell still blew up the bunker and he was killed for it. Morgan got away. But Ernie was able to restore a picture of the original members of the Simon Williams programs. And the final survivor turned out to be Admiral Killbride of the Los Angeles Office.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnnpi2tHnHmq6aoZliv6avwKlkaWldZYZufpJmqp6Zo6S7bn6Mnqeiq5%2BZsm59j2abnp2gYrOit8Ro</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fncis-hawai-i-recap-01-09-23-season-2-episode-10-deep-fake.html&text=NCIS%20Hawaii%20Recap%2001%2f09%2f23%3a%20Season%202%20Episode%2010%20Deep%20Fake&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fncis-hawai-i-recap-01-09-23-season-2-episode-10-deep-fake.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fncis-hawai-i-recap-01-09-23-season-2-episode-10-deep-fake.html&title=NCIS%20Hawaii%20Recap%2001%2f09%2f23%3a%20Season%202%20Episode%2010%20Deep%20Fake" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fncis-hawai-i-recap-01-09-23-season-2-episode-10-deep-fake.html&title=NCIS%20Hawaii%20Recap%2001%2f09%2f23%3a%20Season%202%20Episode%2010%20Deep%20Fake" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fncis-hawai-i-recap-01-09-23-season-2-episode-10-deep-fake.html&title=NCIS%20Hawaii%20Recap%2001%2f09%2f23%3a%20Season%202%20Episode%2010%20Deep%20Fake" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fncis-hawai-i-recap-01-09-23-season-2-episode-10-deep-fake.html&description=NCIS%20Hawaii%20Recap%2001%2f09%2f23%3a%20Season%202%20Episode%2010%20Deep%20Fake" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rose-mcgowan-strikes-back-at-haters-who-claim-she-looks-like-michael-jackson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rose McGowan strikes back at haters who claim she looks like Michael Jackson">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./michael-bayley-net-worth-2024-wallmine.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="MichaelBayley Net Worth (2024) | wallmine">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
