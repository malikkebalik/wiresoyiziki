Up first was Team John. John along with the great Wynonna helped get the first battling trio up to scratch. John paired Deejay Young with Stee and Lila Forde. Deejay chose “Breaking My Heart (Pretty Brown Eyes)”. Lila chose “Fire And Rain”. Stee chose “Pretty Wings”. They all chose such soulful music and they all wanted to beat each other, but there could be only one winner. Most of the contestants tonight have professional singing experience. They’ve been playing at wedding venues or at bars. And Deejay was a tough one to beat because he was the only one tonight with Broadway experience.</p><p>Deejay was used to singing to large crowds. He knew how to style his stage persona. He was completely flawless tonight and it sucked for the other two because they had to go second and third. Only they were also highly skilled. They were all true threats. Stee probably was evenly matched with Deejay while Lila still needed to work on her confidence onstage. Only they all gave a great concert all by their lonesome. The other judges all gave their opinion. They all love Lila only they firmly believe Stee pulled out ahead with that head spin at the end of his performance.</p><p>Reba was the one person that thought Lila won this one. It could be because the song was a favorite of hers. Maybe that’s why she didn’t see the real competition was between Deejay and Stee, but then John surprised everyone by naming Lila as the winner of this competition. She was good. Her rendition was good. It simply wasn’t quite a match for Stee or Deejay. Gwen used her Steal to get Stee. As the real travesty of no one stealing Deejay went unsaid by everyone. Team Niall was next. He was touring and so he left his artists in Dan + Shay’s hands.</p><p>Those two were joining the Voice for the next season as the first double act for judges. Before he left, Niall paired Huntley with Noah Spencer and Claudia B. Claudia chose “Don’t Know Why”. Huntley chose “Dead Or Alive”. Noah chose “Where Rainbows Never Die”. Noah had steep competition with Huntley. Huntley was the extrovert. Noah was the introvert. Claudia was in the middle. Noah acted as the silent killer while Huntley was an infamous serial killer. And again, Claudia was in the middle with a shover on the subway because her talent can sneak up on you.</p><p>Claudia has the skill to perform the piano as well as sing. Noah plays the guitar. Huntley very well knew he needed no instruments to ease him into things. They were all good friends and so they cheered the others on during rehearsals. Huntley knew the other two were still serious threats. Claudia can work herself into a groove. Noah could ease anyone into cheerfulness. Huntley meanwhile blew everyone away with his voice. He even received a standing ovation from some of the judges after his performance tonight.</p><p>They all put on great performances. Niall had the toughest decision tonight because he had to name a winner out of a trio of great artists. This wasn’t like the flyby of Team Gwen’s team when she chose Bias. This was a real competition. Niall later named Huntley as the winner. He also used his Save on Claudia. John also tried to use his Steal for Claudia. Claudia chose to stick it out with Niall and so then John tried to use his Steal on Noah only Reba also used her steal for Noah. And of course he had to go with Queen Reba.</p><p>John got none of the golden trio. Next up was Team Reba. Reba paired Ms. Monét with Ruby Leigh and Rachele Nguyen. Ms. Monét chose “Best Of My Love”. She said everyone can’t help smiling when they hear that song. Ruby chose “Blue”. Rachel surprised everyone by choosing a country song. She said she listens to diverse artists and she wanted to show off something new onstage. She chose “Die From A Broken Heart”. Rachel and Ruby were both on the young side. One sang a song about girlhood and the other joined Ms. Monét in singing about womanhood.</p><p>Ms. Monét was the powerhouse. Ruby was the classics. Rachel was the Pop girl that could go anywhere. They were all captivating. They all brought something different to Reba’s team. This one was a tough one for her. She was wowed by Ms. Monét. She got to recollect the past with Ruby. She also got to see the future of Country with Rachel. Only she felt that certain bits of the past were getting lost in looking for the new or the different. Reba named Ruby as the winner of the Knockout because she loved the classics.</p><p>Sadly, no one grabbed up Ms. Monét and that was also it for Rahcel tonight. There was also a moment in which they did their promo for the Trolls movie. The movie was going to be music filled with joy and that’s why it came on during as well as after tonight’s episode. But the next Knockout was on Team Gwen. Gwen paired Corii with Kristen Brown and Kara Tenae. Corii chose “Aint It Fun”. She was a powerhouse that gave it her all and well she was told that its okay if she relaxes into the song. She was singing it like her life on the line only that was misconstruing the lyrics.</p><p>Kara chose “Leave (Get Out)”. She was in a toxic relationship at one time and it took her four years to get out. She chose this song because she resonates with it. Only she too had too much emotion tied with the song. Now Kristen chose “This One’s For the Girls”. She helps a group of girls bring out their own talents and so she wanted to sing this one for them. It was light. It was fun. They were all fun tonight. Corii tried to ease into the song like Gwen suggested. Kara tried to put more power into the song like Gwen suggested.</p><p>Then along came Kristen who got surprisingly emotional. None of them were perfect. None of them truly followed everything Gwen said and so Gwen ultimately name Kara as the winner of this Knockout. This was the end of the road for Corii. Only John used his Steal on Kristen. And so two were saved tonight thanks to the judges.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnpJ2ybsLOopqeZaKasKK8jGpoZmljYn90edKemKynnmJ%2FdXnEqaCsp5SaenKBjK2fnmWbo7ykt86uq6xloJa%2FtXmSaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-voice-recap-11-13-23-season-24-episode-15-the-knockouts-part-3.html&text=The%20Voice%20Recap%2011%2f13%2f23%3a%20Season%2024%20Episode%2015%20The%20Knockouts%20Part%203&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-voice-recap-11-13-23-season-24-episode-15-the-knockouts-part-3.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-voice-recap-11-13-23-season-24-episode-15-the-knockouts-part-3.html&title=The%20Voice%20Recap%2011%2f13%2f23%3a%20Season%2024%20Episode%2015%20The%20Knockouts%20Part%203" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-voice-recap-11-13-23-season-24-episode-15-the-knockouts-part-3.html&title=The%20Voice%20Recap%2011%2f13%2f23%3a%20Season%2024%20Episode%2015%20The%20Knockouts%20Part%203" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-voice-recap-11-13-23-season-24-episode-15-the-knockouts-part-3.html&title=The%20Voice%20Recap%2011%2f13%2f23%3a%20Season%2024%20Episode%2015%20The%20Knockouts%20Part%203" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-voice-recap-11-13-23-season-24-episode-15-the-knockouts-part-3.html&description=The%20Voice%20Recap%2011%2f13%2f23%3a%20Season%2024%20Episode%2015%20The%20Knockouts%20Part%203" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alleged-details-revealed-of-what-david-eason-did-to-jace-evans.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alleged Details Revealed of What David Eason Did to Jace Evans">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./phil-mickelson-s-career-earnings-just-crossed-1-billion-thanks-to-liv-league-payday.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Phil Mickelson's Career Earnings Just Crossed $1 Billion Thanks To LIV League Payday">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
