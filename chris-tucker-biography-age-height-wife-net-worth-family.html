A representative blamed "poor accounting and business management".</p><p>In 2011, Tucker made a comeback to stand-up comedy. The next year, he returned to film in Silver Linings Playbook, co-starring Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and Robert De Niro. Tucker's performance in the film was well received by critics and audiences alike. The film itself received numerous nominations and awards including the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Cast. He also hosted the 2013 BET Awards. In 2016 he appeared in Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk.</p><p>Tucker was announced in 2007 to star in the New Line drama film Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra, directed by <a href=#>Brett Ratner</a> and based on George Jacobs's autobiography of working as Frank Sinatra's valet during the Rat Pack era of 1953–68.</p><p>Tucker participated in professor Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s 2006 PBS documentary on the genetic makeup of African Americans, African American Lives, that specifically focused on stories of Native American heritage in African-American communities. Tucker's DNA test results showed African, European, and "likely some Native American" ancestors. Tucker's patrilineal ancestry was also traced back to the Ambundu ethnic group of Angola and one line of his mother's to the Bamileke of Cameroon. He also traced his family tree back to the 1830s. Tucker and Gates were shown visiting Angola, the birthplace of some of his ancestors.</p><p>Tucker is good friends with fellow Rush Hour co-star Jackie Chan. He was also close with singer Michael Jackson: introducing and dancing with him at his 30th Anniversary Celebration; appearing in his video "You Rock My World" from the 2001 album Invincible; and attending his memorial service. Tucker's career was also influenced by Jackson, as he is seen dancing and singing to "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" in a scene in Rush Hour 2 and imitating Jackson's dancing style in Friday. He endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 primaries.</p><p>Tucker did not reprise his role as Smokey in Next Friday (2000) or in Friday After Next (2002) because he had become a born-again Christian after filming Money Talks (1997). He starred in Michael Jackson's video "You Rock My World" and made a cameo appearance in Tupac Shakur's "California Love". On February 13, 1999, Tucker participated in the NBA All-Star Weekend's Celebrity Game. Other celebrities participating included rapper Master P, NBA Hall of Famers <a href=#>Clyde Drexler</a> and <a href=#>Dominique Wilkins</a>, wide receiver <a href=#>Terrell Owens</a>, and four Harlem Globetrotters.</p><p>Along with Jackie Chan, Tucker starred in the 1998 martial arts action comedy Rush Hour and its sequels Rush Hour 2 and Rush Hour 3, in which he played LAPD detective <a href=#>James Carter</a>. After the commercial success of the first Rush Hour, he held out for a $20 million salary for Rush Hour 2, and was paid $25 million for Rush Hour 3. The latter was part of a $40 million two-movie contract with New Line Cinema that also included an unnamed future film. He was also to receive 20% of the gross from Rush Hour 3.</p><p>Tucker began showcasing his comedy skills before an audience in local Atlanta comedy clubs until he decided to move to Los Angeles at 19 to further pursue his stand-up comedy career. In 1992, Tucker was a frequent performer on Def Comedy Jam. He made his cinematic debut in House Party 3 and gained greater film recognition alongside rapper Ice Cube in the 1995 film Friday. In 1997, he co-starred with Charlie Sheen in Money Talks and alongside Bruce Willis in The Fifth Element. Also in 1997, he played a supporting role in <a href=#>Jackie Brown</a>. Double-O-Soul was a spy comedy in which Tucker had a starring role, but the film was never released.</p><p>Christopher Tucker (born August 31, 1971) is an American actor and stand-up comedian. He is known for his roles as Detective <a href=#>James Carter</a> in Brett Ratner's Rush Hour film series and Smokey in F. Gary Gray's Friday. He became a frequent stand up performer on Def Comedy Jam in the 1990s. He appeared in Luc Besson's The Fifth Element, Quentin Tarantino's <a href=#>Jackie Brown</a>, David O. Russell's Silver Linings Playbook, and Brett Ratner's Money Talks.</p><p>Tucker was born on August 31, 1971 in Atlanta, Georgia, the youngest son of Mary Louise (née Bryant) and Norris Tucker. One of six children, Tucker learned early in life that humor had the power to draw attention to himself both at school and at home. His father was an independent businessman who owned a janitorial service. Tucker grew up in Decatur, Georgia, and after graduating from Columbia High School, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in comedy and acting. His early comedy influences were Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor, and he was known by his teachers and high school classmates for making people laugh by doing impressions of Murphy, Michael Jackson, and others. Tucker grew up in a Pentecostal Christian household, as his mother and father were members of the Church of God in Christ during his childhood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfmLWztdJmq66bm5q%2F</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchris-tucker-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&text=Chris%20Tucker%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchris-tucker-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchris-tucker-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&title=Chris%20Tucker%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchris-tucker-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&title=Chris%20Tucker%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchris-tucker-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&title=Chris%20Tucker%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchris-tucker-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html&description=Chris%20Tucker%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./emmy-rossum-24-adam-duritz-46-were-done-two-months-ago.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emmy Rossum (24) &amp;amp; Adam Duritz (46) were done two months ago">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./xernona-clayton-ethnicity-nationality-religion-and-parents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Xernona Clayton Ethnicity, Nationality Religion And Parents">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
