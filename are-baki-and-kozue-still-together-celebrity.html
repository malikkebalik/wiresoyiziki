I wanted to know if they breaks up since I dont read the manga. I dont know if the manga ended so I want spoilers. Kozue doesn’t break up with Baki, in fact she’s quite literally the one supporting him the most in his final fight with Yujiro.</p><p>What happened to Baki’s girlfriend, Kozue Matsumoto? The character of Kozue was indeed faded into the background and written out of the anime, which is peculiar since her love had the ability to give Baki greater strength to fight.</p><p>Kozue Matsumoto (松本 梢江, Matsumoto Kozue) is a fictional character from anime and manga series of Baki the Grappler. She is Baki Hanma’s schoolmate and the daughter of Kinuyo Matsumoto, Baki’s landlady. In later parts of the series, Kozue is also his girlfriend. Her father fought and died in the Underground Arena .</p><p>The character of Kozue was indeed faded into the background and written out of the anime, which is peculiar since her love had the ability to give Baki greater strength to fight.</p><h2>Why did Kozue come around in Baki?</h2><p>The couple met in season 1 and, at the time, Kozue was unsupportive of Baki’s violent career. Eventually she came around<strong> because she cared for him.</strong> Only in season 2 did the romance start to go downhill when they became stuck in a love triangle with Mohammad Alai Jr, who fell in love with Kozue.</p><p>The character of Kozue was indeed<strong> faded into the background and written out of the anime, which is peculiar</strong> since her love had the ability to give Baki greater strength to fight.</p><p>Baki Hanma landed on Netflix on<strong> Thursday, 30 September 2021,</strong> without much attention on Baki’s girlfriend – Kozue Matsumoto – what happened to their romance?</p><p>Following<strong> 17-year-old</strong> Baki, the second-strongest fighter in the world, the anime is a fans’ favourite thanks to the hero’s endless fighting scenes and occasional romance with Kozue Matsumoto.</p><p>Because of that, she’s<strong> no longer required </strong>.</p><p>Another commented manga artist<strong> Itagaki</strong> “pretty much abandons all female characters from this point in the series”, which could eventually be explained in later arcs.</p><p>In<strong> the end</strong> Kozue rejected Mohammad and saw herself as a motherly figure towards him, but her relationship with Baki was never the same afterwards.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><h2>Who is Baki’s girlfriend?</h2><p>Then there are characters who are used as plot vehicles, like Baki’s girlfriend<strong> Kozue.</strong> In the anime,<strong> Kozue </strong>‘s tears help to heal Baki, and when he sleeps with her, he becomes stronger.</p><p>Baki Hanma is a<strong> very specific</strong> type of anime too in that it’s extremely violent and hyper-masculine. And even though lots of folks watch it for its action, and ridiculously jacked dudes, there are some narrative questions a lot of people have. For instance, what happened to Baki’s girlfriend?</p><p>A lot of longtime fans of the series have noticed that there’s a specific point in the series where Keisuke Itagaki seemingly “abandons” all of the female characters in the manga. Kozue does small make returns in the manga, however. In chapter 186 of the “Son of Ogre” storyline, Kozue actually does appear right before Baki fights his dad, the world’s most vicious and accomplished martial artist.</p><h2>What does Kozue explain to Baki?</h2><p>Kozue explains to him that<strong> she doesn’t understand the sense of brutal hurting themselves in the ring.</strong> Baki explains to her that<strong> every man at least once in his life has dreamt of becoming the strongest in the world, and therefore some people are still fighting to make their dreams come true.</strong></p><p>When he’s not home, Kozue feeds<strong> Musashi,</strong> Baki’s dog. A scene is shown where Kozue brings Baki dinner from his mother and kindly points out that he hadn’t been to school for a long time. In that moment it can be seen that Kozue shows some signs of worrying about Baki.</p><p>Shortly before Baki fights Mount Toba,<strong> Kozue is kidnapped and abducted by some school thugs.</strong> Her school friend, Mai, notifies the police about it, but the problem is ignored. Baki gets into action when Mai explains the case to him.</p><p>She can be often seen wearing her school uniform. In the first two anime seasons, she was wearing a dark school uniform, but in the third season, she started to wearing a school uniform with a white t-shirt. Kozue is a girl with a pretty small physique, but also quite shapely.</p><p>Before the start of the final fight in the tournament, Baki<strong> lies down on Kozue’s lap and relaxes before his match with Jack.</strong> Moment before the start of the final, Baki is having an important conversation with Kozue in the corridor.</p><p>Kozue is a pretty girl with brown eyes and hair. In the OVA version, her hair was black and glowed slightly in dark blue color. Kozue has quite long hair, which she often braids. At the beginning of the first series, she had a fringe pulled on her forehead.</p><p>Her height is average. She is not much lower than Baki Hanma, who is less than 170 cm tall, so Kozue is certainly about<strong> 160 cm</strong> tall.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGiYq51dl66stYyapZ1lm6THtrGMrKuipJxiwbCzxK2fnqpdbYJ4fJNo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fare-baki-and-kozue-still-together-celebrity.html&text=Are%20Baki%20And%20Kozue%20Still%20Together%3f%20%20Celebrity&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-baki-and-kozue-still-together-celebrity.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-baki-and-kozue-still-together-celebrity.html&title=Are%20Baki%20And%20Kozue%20Still%20Together%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fare-baki-and-kozue-still-together-celebrity.html&title=Are%20Baki%20And%20Kozue%20Still%20Together%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fare-baki-and-kozue-still-together-celebrity.html&title=Are%20Baki%20And%20Kozue%20Still%20Together%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-baki-and-kozue-still-together-celebrity.html&description=Are%20Baki%20And%20Kozue%20Still%20Together%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brian-boitano-net-worth-lifestyle-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brian Boitano Net Worth: Lifestyle &amp;amp; Career">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tom-cruise-has-made-soooo-much-money-from-mission-impossible.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tom Cruise Has Made Soooo Much Money From Mission Impossible">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
